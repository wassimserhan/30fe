		<title><![CDATA[The Attractive Tractive: Proving That a Lack of Winter Tires Contributed to a Collision]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[With so much information available these days it can be difficult to distinguish the root cause of a collision from things that may just be contributing factors or worse yet, simply unrelated matters of circumstance. The problem when it comes to winter tires generally stems from a lack of understanding of what makes them different from all-season tires and what those differences mean in terms of vehicle performance.

The article explains the unique characteristics of winter tires, and why they are necessary for cold and snowy Canadian winters. They key: the ‘softness’ of your tire will allow it to adhere to the cold and icy road better than all-season ‘hard’ tires. The compounds in winter tires are generally softer at the same temperatures than those used in all-season tires and are formulated to better adhere to ice and snow.

The article then explores the effect winter tires have on collisions. For instance, the variety of configurations in which winter tires are mounted on vehicles can have a significant effect.

		<title><![CDATA[Escalators Not Always a Walk in the Park]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Rob Parkinson and Brittany Sinclair write for The Lawyer’s Daily explaining the risks associated with escalators. When walking on an escalator, people are exposed to the potential of tripping and falling. The Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) reported that from 212 to 2014 there were more than 800 injuries associated with escalator passengers in Ontario, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) estimated that 75 per cent of escalator injuries in the U.S. resulted from falls. Escalator design, maintenance and operations are governed by safety standards to ensure safe use for the public.

The article outlines building standards for escalators required for public safety, and the possibly risks associated with the differences between escalators and traditional stairs. The article also explains possible behaviours of individuals using escalators, and the probable cues they use to ensure safe use.

		<title><![CDATA[The Influence of Interactions Between External Task Demands in Lifting on Estimates of IN VIVO Low Back Joint Loads]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[30 Forensic Engineering’s (formerly Giffin Koerth Forensic Engineering) Dr. Chad Gooyers worked with his colleagues at the University of Toronto, the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College and the University of Waterloo to study the effects of external load magnitude, movement speed and symmetry of initial load placement on the lower back during an occupational lifting task.

The most commonly accepted mechanical risk factors linked to low back injury include: high force demands, frequent repetition and awkward postures. However, these exposures have typically been examined in isolation, and are often assumed to contribute independently to risk of injury. As such, our understanding of the combined effects of different external task demands on low back joint loading and injury may be limited.

Studying the effects of external load magnitude, movement speed and symmetry of initial load placement on the lower back show that risk factors should not be viewed in isolation. Rather, injury prevention efforts need to consider the complex interactions that exist between external task demands and their combined influence on internal joint loading.

		<title><![CDATA[Exploring the Regional Response of the Intervertebral Disc Under Postural Varying Loads]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[30 Forensic Engineering’s (formerly Giffin Koerth Forensic Engineering) Dr. Chad Gooyers worked with his colleagues at the University of Waterloo to investigate the differences between the anterior and posterior radial displacement of the annulus of the intervertebral disc. Generally, there have been very few studies that have quantified the magnitude of IVD disc bulging on the posterior aspect of the disc. This is attributable to bony structures and passive tissues that obstruct a direct line-of-sight to the posterior-lateral region of intact functional spinal units.

The preliminary results from this investigation explains a link between measured AF bulge on the anterior and posterior side of the IVD. Understanding how the AF responds under various loads in flexion and extension postures has clinical relevance, as IVD herniation has been observed with repeated flexion-extension under modest amounts of compressive load. The magnitude of posterior AF bulge increased in flexion as the magnitude of the applied compressive load increased. As such, the magnitude of strain and risk of tissue damage in the AF is expected to follow a similar trend.

		<title><![CDATA[The Effect of Age on the Mechanical Properties of Porcine Intervertebral Discs Following a Cyclic Loading Protocol]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The North American working population is aging. American workers over 55 comprised 19% of the labour force in 2010 and the proportion of Canadian workers over 55 increased by 21.7% between 1997 and 2010. Occupational injuries sustained by American workers 65 and older resulting in a lost-time claim increased by 6.4% between 2007 and 2008. The low back was the body location ranked highest in number of injuries sustained among Ontario workers in 2013, accounting for 17% of all lost time claims, with the leading demographic group 50-54 year old males. A mechanistic understanding of the age-related responses to loading in spinal tissues is essential to the prevention of low back injury throughout the aging process. Known age-related changes to the intervertebral discs (IVD’s) of the spine include; the denaturation of collagen fibres, reduction/altered distribution of proteoglycans, and an increased propensity to form microstructural clefts in response to tensile loading when compared to more juvenile samples. The aim of this investigation was to quantify the effects of age on the mechanical properties of annulus fibrosis tissue following exposure to cyclic loading.

		<title><![CDATA[A Biomechanist's Role]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[When the damages of a claim arise from personal injuries, a qualified biomechanist can determine if there is a causal relationship between the claimed injuries and the reported event. A biomechanist has a unique theoretical and experimental background, which enables the understanding of fundamental engineering principles as it relates to the biological tissues of the body, such as bones, ligaments, muscles and the brain. Thus, a biomechanist can understand – and effectively communicate – the mechanisms of injury and the likelihood of them occurring. Simply, a biomechanist is an engineer – or scientist – who studies the human body instead of machines, buildings or bridges. As a result, claims involving expertise in injury biomechanics can often be more interesting than typical types of losses.

When a claim is reported – and the injuries don’t appear to be consistent with the reported circumstances – a biomechanist can quantify the likelihood of a resulting injury. Information on how injuries are sustained can be useful in determining the actual damages associated with an incident and how to handle the claim. The article explores four different case studies in which an insurer or claims adjuster can benefit from injury biomechanics expertise.

		<title><![CDATA[A Mistaken Understanding of Injury]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[We have all heard the expression, “the straw that broke the camel’s back”. For biomechanists, it is a simple way to describe a minor event, which results in an unexpected injury. Unfortunately, the concept of a trivial event being responsible for an unexpected injury has been accepted by far too many intelligent people and has led to poor determinations of cause and effect in the insurance and legal industries. However, with a basic understanding of injury, there is some valuable knowledge contained within this expression.

The article explores the cause and effect of injuries – and the misconception that small events can cause serious injury. Most of the time, the real cause of a serious injury is due to progressive weakening. This is referred to as a fatigue related injury. Using our example, if the camel’s spine was already weakening because of too much work and not enough rest. The injury was therefore predictable. The article also discusses the examples of rotator cuff injuries and disc herniation.

Finally, the legal question of understanding a fatigue related injury in the context of individuals who are already in the process of advancing their injury are already in a very unstable state is explored.

		<content><![CDATA[A high prevalence of low back pain has been reported among professional drivers, including mobile police officers. The purpose of this investigation was to develop and evaluate a novel thoracic support designed for mobile police officers. Fourteen participants (7 male, 7 female) attended two 120-min driving simulations using a Crown Victoria Interceptor seat and the same seat equipped with a surface mounted thoracic support. Time-varying spine postures, seat pressures and ratings of discomfort were measured. Averaged discomfort values were low (less than 10 mm of a possible 100 mm) for both seating conditions. The postures in the thoracic support condition were more similar to non-occupational driving without occupational equipment than the Crown Victoria seating condition. The reduction in pressure area at the low back with the thoracic support has the potential to reduce discomfort reporting in officers compared to a standard vehicle package.

		<title><![CDATA[The Role of the Injury Biomechanist in Personal Injury and Accident Reconstruction]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Rob Parkinson and Michael Sinnott explore the important role a biomechanist has in personal injury and accident reconstruction claims. The article begins by explaining what an injury biomechanist is – they are scientists or engineers who have a unique background in aspects of both mechanical engineering and human biology, which includes training in: physics and mathematics; human anatomy and physiology; failure testing of biological tissue; and injury mechanisms. The ability to interrelate engineering and biological concepts uniquely positions an injury biomechanist to study, understand and effectively communicate the mechanisms of injury and their likelihood.

Biomechanists investigate many types of injuries including: sports/recreational injuries; motor vehicle collisions; slips, trips and falls; product failure; and occupational injury. Their experience in engineering and the understanding of injury allows them to be qualified to discuss the force-injury relationship and can therefore provide the necessary expertise in determining causation.

Injury biomechanists do many things: they assess the location and severity of the injury, relate the injury to likely forces and motions involved, determine adequate thresholds, and assess safety margin and injury risk.

Finally, the article discusses when a biomechanist may be needed, and the importance of clear, concise and unbiased communication.

		<title><![CDATA[The Cost of Technology]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Technological advances in a number of industries have created gains in efficiency, but have driven up claims costs at the same time. When we think about technology we generally envision computers, cell phones and other electronic devices, but technology extends to the materials used in goods, the robots and machines used in industry, the telecommunications infrastructure, and more. Technology is ubiquitous; it is everywhere and in everything we use. The ongoing evolutions in the wide variety of technologies that permeate society make claims difficult to investigate and often much more costly as those technologies can change.

While technology has obvious benefits to society, its increasing complexity challenges the insurance industry. Where objects, materials and processes were historically simple, they are now often complicated systems which require experts to understand them. Failures of small components can have very extensive repercussions for larger systems – shutting down large offices and assembly lines. This makes assessing risk, investigating claims and subrogation much more difficult and costly. Brokers with clients in technology-driven industries are advised to closely monitor developments and review the adequacy of coverage regularly.

		<title><![CDATA[Addressing Different Viewpoints: Working Together to Identify All Aspects of a Complex Claim]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[As any professional can attest, it is a full-time job to be on top of the changes in your area of specialization, particularly with recent advancements in research and technology. Insurers are feeling the effects of these changes as the claims they see continue to grow in complexity. It is becoming even more necessary for insurers to seek experts capable of identifying and addressing issues related to a claim.

Given the rapid development of forensics, each area of expertise now requires full-time dedication – it is becoming clear that a single individual cannot possibly maintain a competency in multiple areas. It is important for insurers to have the right firm and proper expertise supporting them while managing a file, so that important decisions can be made with confidence. In cases where a file manager is not sure of their expert’s qualifications, they should never hesitate to ask for a CV. If the file manager is not convinced, then it is unlikely the other side will be convinced, let alone the judge or jury.

		<title><![CDATA[Managing Hazardous Materials During Demolition and Reconstruction: The Claims Perspective]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Whether resulting from wind, fire or water damage, insurance claims often involve the demolition, reconstruction and restoration of buildings and property. Insurance companies and adjusters often take on the task of initiating and managing the related contractor restoration and reconstruction activities. In so doing, they may take on the equivalent role of the owner in that they may tender, contract and administer payment of contractors directly. Along with this role comes some important regulatory compliance requirements and responsibilities within the province of Ontario (and other provinces that insurance and claims professionals must be aware of. Failure to undertake the necessary pre-demolition and reconstruction surveys of hazardous materials, asbestos in particular, can create exposure to potential liability and legal penalties for those involved.

Section 30 of the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act states that designated substances and other potentially hazardous building materials must be identified prior to construction or demolition activities that could potentially disturb such materials. Additionally, Regulation O. Reg. 278/05 – Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings applies to the disturbance of asbestos-containing materials (ACM’s) on construction projects. Failure to carry out this critical regulatory requirement can carry with it significant consequences under the Act.

		<title><![CDATA[Characterizing the Combined Effects of Force, Repetition and Posture on Injury Pathways and Micro-Structural Damage in Isolated Functional Spinal Units from Sub-Acute-Failure Magnitudes of Cyclic Compressive Loading]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Chad Gooyers worked with his colleagues at the University of Waterloo to investigate the magnitude of peak compressive force applied during cyclic loading exceeds 30% of a functional spinal unit’s estimated ultimate compressive tolerance, fatigue failure of the cartilaginous endplate or vertebra will occur before intervertebral disc herniation.

Three levels of peak compressive force, three cycle rates and two dynamic postural conditions were examined using a full-factorial design. Cyclic compressive force was applied using a modified material testing apparatus, in accordance with a biofidelic time-varying waveform with synchronous flexion/extension rotation for 5000 cycles. Annulus fibrosus tissue from 36 “survivor” FSUs was excised for histological analysis.

It was found that 80% of specimens survived 5000 cycles of cyclic loading. A marked difference of the magnitude of peak compressive force was noted in the Kaplan–Meier survival function of experimental conditions that induced fatigue injury. Overall, in the 40% ultimate compressive tolerance load condition, the probability of survival was less than 67%. The micro-structural damage detected in excised samples of annulus fibrosus tissue consisted of clefts and fissures within the intra-lamellar matrix, as well as delamination within the inter-lamellar matrix.

Consistent with previous research, our findings support a threshold of peak compressive force of 30% ultimate compressive tolerance, where cyclic loading above this level will likely result in fatigue injury in less than 5000 cycles of in vitro mechanical loading. However, findings from our histological analyses demonstrate that considerable micro-structural damage occurred in specimens that “survived” the cyclic loading exposure.

		<title><![CDATA[Expert Witnesses: Hired Guns or Truth Seekers]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Why is it that some expert witnesses do more than seek truth and go beyond merely assisting the trier of the fact, which is the legal foundation for their role as an expert witness, and cross the line, becoming a true hired gun or advocate? An expert should not care which side hires them, because the truth is still the truth. First off, it’s important to know when the case is bad. A truth seeker is not always able to help their client in the manner a hired gun can. A truth seeker does, however, help a client that has a bad case by making that client fully aware that they have a bad case. This can avoid hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal expense for the client in a losing case. Testimony from an expert witness must always be based on accepted science. Fortunately, the current climate in the court system is leaning away from simply accepting expert witness testimony at face value. The expert must now be both articulate and technically correct.

So, what can the insurance industry do to protect itself? Obviously, make sure that the expert is technically qualified. Can the expert communicate effectively? How is the expert’s company structured? Is it a sole proprietorship or one that embraces the opinions of all its employees and supports internal peer review of its findings? Finally, be wary of the expert that is unwilling to admit a mistake – we all make them.

		<title><![CDATA[Fire Scene Safety for Adjusters]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Fire scenes can be extremely hazardous, with even minor fires having numerous potential dangers. However, depending on the degree and timing of fire scene participation, all of these dangers can either be eliminated or protected against with the most practical methods. The article covers the individuals who are typically on the scene of a fire (during and post), the hazards that may be encountered at the fire scene and the precautions individuals should always take.

Types of hazards typically encountered include structural instability, loose building components, openings in or weakened floors, slippery surfaces, poor visibility and jumbled interior contents, natural gas or propane, electrical systems, drug labs, chemicals, airborne contaminants, communicable diseases, and fatigue.

Precautions one should always take are: don’t assume anything; if the structure has been damaged, have it inspected by a qualified person; ensure you have adequate lighting; do not enter a badly damaged building if you are tired or sick; avoid entering a badly damaged structure alone, particularly in remote or isolated areas and; wear appropriate attire.

Safety on a fire scene is similar to safety anywhere else. Use common sense, don’t rush, be knowledgeable about your environment and consistently follow proven safety procedures.

		<title><![CDATA[Bill C-45]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[In order to assist in 30 Forensic Engineering’s ongoing promotion of the health &amp; safety of our own staff and clients, the following summary points (as supplied by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health &amp; Safety website) regarding this important piece of Health &amp; safety legislation are provided for your consideration and review.

The summary article reviews what Bill C-45 is – it is federal legislation that amends the Canadian Criminal Code. Bill C-45 became law on March 31, 2004 and is now the new Section 217.1 in the Criminal Code which reads:

“2.17.1 Every one who undertakes, or has the authority, to direct how another person does work or performs a task is under a legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent bodily harm to that person, or any other person, arising from that work or task.”

The bill established new legal duties for workplace health and safety, and imposes serious penalties for violations that result in injuries or death. It also establishes rules for attributing criminal liability to organizations, including corporations, for the acts of their representatives and also creates a legal duty for all persons directing work to take “reasonable steps” to ensure the safety of workers and the public.

The article also covers why the bill was created; what the main provisions are; who the Criminal Code affects; who is responsible for enforcing the Criminal Code; who is responsible for enforcing occupational health and safety laws and; how the reader can ensure a safe workplace and limit their liability.

		<content><![CDATA[How clean is “clean” when it comes to property damage and the health side effects associated with illicit meth labs? While the health effects of the drug on users are well understood, one aspect of meth production that is often overlooked is the property damage caused by these clandestine operations and the potential harm to the health of individuals who occupy a former meth lab. In this article, Kirstin explores the typical cleaning and remediation procedures used as meth labs are relatively consistent between guidelines documents; however, the acceptable post-remediation clearance limit for residual meth surface concentrations vary widely amongst current standards. There are few guidelines that exist within Canada for the remediation of buildings used for the synthesis of illegal substances. What does this mean for remediation contractors and environmental consultants when there is a regulatory void?

One option is to look to the American state legislature, as well as further abroad, for guidance in these matters. In the United States, no federal regulation exists. Instead, regulations are developed and implemented by individual states. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also has a set of voluntary guidelines for meth lab remediation, which includes conducting pre-remediation surface sampling to determine the extent of the chemical contamination, the sequence of remediation steps, and post-remediation sampling to confirm that the chemical contaminants have been successfully removed.

In the absence of Canadian legislature in this area, a qualified and experience consultant, public health official, and/or hygienist should provide guidance to the cleaning and remedial contractor.

		<title><![CDATA[Preservation of Evidence in the Face of Testing and Examinations]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[By the very nature of some of the evidence received, it’s almost impossible to “preserve” evidence. In order to conduct testing, some evidence may need to be taken apart – or have “destructive testing” implemented. The article discusses some ways to ensure that potential conflicts or issues are minimized.

First off, there must be a reason for examinations and/or testing. Where a loss has occurred and a device, part or appliance is suspected to have caused or contributed to a loss, it may be necessary to examine and potentially test the item to confirm that was the case. The first step in ensuring a successful case is to document the chain of custody. Next, it is important to note the make, model, serial number and any other features that will allow for the proper identification of the manufacturer of the item so that they can be put on notice, if required.

It may seem like “putting the cast before the horse” to come up with some ideas of how the item could have failed, prior to examining it for more conclusively determining that very point. But different failure scenarios could result in different consequences for that item.

There are also a variety of non-destructive tests that can be employed in many instances, especially when the failed item is a simple device, such as failed pipes or hoses, failed couplings, failed steel building elements, etc. It’s important to develop an examination and testing protocol for the subject evidence – it provides consensus amongst all parties involved and avoids conflict down the line.

Last, but not least – document, document, document!

		<title><![CDATA[Biomechanics: Injury and Design Considerations]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Life is full of activities that are engaging, stimulating, and exciting. Activities such as walking, running, cycling, driving, flying, and playing sports are daily occurrences. While the individual and societal benefits of these activities are numerous there are risks associated with many of these activities. Thus, design approaches and standards are developed to limit the potential for injury to occur under expected conditions.

When structures such as buildings or bridges are designed, the materials used for construction can be manufactured, processed and tested to accurately characterize their mechanical properties and establish the conditions that are required to cause failure. In contrast, designing environments for work, recreation and travel cannot rely on the same type of extensive testing for all the different anatomical structures in the living human body, for obvious moral and ethical reasons. As the properties of an individual’s muscle, bone, ligaments and tendons cannot be determined under the vast array of conditions that the human body is exposed to, predictions of the body’s response are needed. For this reason, the science of biomechanics, which examines how the body both generates and responds to force, employs a variety of techniques to provide insight into how and why injuries occur. With this approach, biomechanics allows scientists and engineers to design environments, activities and protective equipment to reduce the risk and occurrence of both acute and chronic injuries.

This article highlights the role of biomechanics as a design consideration surrounding a variety of activities and exposures, as well as in less frequent traumatic events. It is hoped that the reader gains a basic understanding of how biomechanics expertise plays a significant and distinct role in the analysis of human-world interaction, in addition to an appreciation of the opportunities and challenges that exist when using predictive methods in the design process.

		<title><![CDATA[Ask the Expert: Why Did the Laval Overpass Collapse]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[In this article, Ron explains the important factors a forensic engineer must consider when trying to answer this question – the million dollar question of “why”? Unfortunately, because there is very little that was shared with the public, not enough evidence is present to provide a conclusive answer. In all likelihood, however, given the age of the overpass and the environment it was in, a strong candidate for primary or contributing cause of the collapse is corrosion of the reinforcing steel contained within the concrete. The article discusses this failure mechanism. The article also discusses ways of dealing with rusting of reinforced steel. Most commonly, reinforced concrete members are repaired by removing all loose concrete, sandblasting the steel and applying fresh concrete patches. A proactive maintenance program, which includes scheduled inspections and repairs when required, can reduce the potential for disaster.

		<title><![CDATA[Investigating Automotive Product Defects]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The constant technological developments in the automotive field present new challenges when investigating automotive defects, because a failed technology might leave no evidence of a problem. Fortunately, Event Data Recorders can provide valuable information when trying to determine what exactly happened just before and during the collision event. As with most investigations, evidence preservation is key to being able to fully investigate not only if a defect did occur, but what caused it and why. Since vehicle technologies are becoming ever more complex and hard to assess, the use and availability of on-board electronic data in the detection of a vehicle defect will continue to increase.

		<title><![CDATA[Belanger et. al. v. The Regional Municipality of Sudbury et. al.]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[On November 22, 2000, Lisa Marie Belanger, then 20 years of age, was driving southbound on Regional Road 35 (RR35) in The Regional Municipality of Sudbury when she lost control of her car, crossed over the centre lane and collided head-on with a northbound school bus. Ms. Belanger was badly injured. In the blink of an eye, her life and the lives of those closest to her were changed forever. This trail was held to determine if the Region of Sudbury is liable for any or all of the losses arising from the accident. Russell Brownlee was an expert witness for the Plaintiff (Belanger et. al.) and testified that the road had, in fact, refrozen during the time of the car crash, and that the Defendant was liable for damages.

		<title><![CDATA[The Laws of Traction: Athletic Footwear and Risk of Injury]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The morning after the Toronto Argonauts defeated the Calgary Stampeders for the 2017 Grey Cup, the CFL published an article titled “<em>Shoe change helps Argos ‘sneak’ up on Stamps</em>,” highlighting the impact a change in footwear had on the Argos’ play.

In true Canadian fashion, the Grey Cup was hosted during the first snowstorm of the year. The Argos got off on the wrong foot in the first half of the game, while players slipped and slid on the snow-covered field. But many of the players changed their footwear for the second half, which the CFL’s Don Landry emphasized as a pivotal moment in the game.

This may have left fans wondering: if the Argos had cleats with better traction, why wouldn’t they always wear them?

Cleat design considers two primary movements performed by athletes: linear movement, which involves moving forward, backwards or side-to-side, and rotational movement such as planting the foot and pivoting to change direction. While cleats should provide enough traction for players to perform such manoeuvres without slipping, too much traction can actually increase an athlete’s risk of injury.

		<title><![CDATA[Zombies Are Among Us]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h3>A brief look into the behavioural science and logic behind 'Zombie Laws.'</h3>
Although the excitement and preparations for trick-or-treaters have been put aside in preparation for the next holiday season, this year it seems that talk of street wandering zombies has hung around longer than in years passed.

Prompted by public safety concern, governments have begun to act to eliminate zombies from our roadway. Spawning out of Honolulu, Hawaii, the aptly-termed <em>Zombie Law</em> took effect to curtail the use of mobile devices by pedestrians while crossing the road. The international response to this law has been swift, as talks of similar laws have crossed the ocean reaching mainland water coolers, offices of the politically inclined and everywhere in between.

<img class="wp-image-2004 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Zombie.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="319" />

In Ontario, Canada, Bill 171 (“Phones Down, Heads Up Act”)<a href="http://www.ontla.on.ca/bills/bills-files/41_Parliament/Session2/b171_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">[1]</a> has been proposed as an amendment to the Highway Traffic Act with an escalating fine structure for repeat offender zombies. Acknowledging that it takes two-to-tango, Bill 171 also mandates annual distracted driving awareness campaigns to combat the concerning number of pedestrians involved in collisions from both sides of the equation.<a href="http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/pdfs/preliminary-2016-orsar-selected-statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">[2]</a>

Distracted driving has been the focus of ample research and legislation over the years. Lagging is a similar focus of attention on pedestrian behaviour and workable measures to reduce catastrophic outcomes. The aim of this article is to shed light on these issues and science leveraged by these new and proposed laws.
<h2><strong>Humans transformed</strong></h2>
Captivated by the attention-sucking capacity of mobile devices, humans shape-shift into dangerously limited versions of themselves. Depending on your penchant for horror movies or Michael Jackson’s <em>Thriller, </em>your understanding of what makes a zombie, a zombie, may differ. Unfortunately for all the MJ fans, not all zombies present in a choreographed dance routine. However, the Hollywood version of zombies can generally be classified as slow-moving, near-living, sometimes drooling, creatures numb to logic or reason. They proceed how they choose with complete disregard for much else. Unfortunately, the city-dwelling, text/Instagram/Snapchat/Facebook (etc)-reading, the more-alive urban civilian can sometimes be shockingly and dangerously similar.

This is precisely the basis for the Zombie Law. The thinking is that by decreasing pedestrian distraction while entering the roadway, pedestrians are able to be more attentive to traffic conditions and will make better and/or more rapid decisions about when or whether to cross.
<blockquote>"...the reality is that in many pedestrian/vehicle collisions, the pedestrian often has the last opportunity to avoid impact..."</blockquote>
The science of otherwise ‘normal’ pedestrian behaviour is clear that non-distracted individuals look to where potential hazards can emerge both before and during roadway crossing. It is thought that by legislating a limit to the extent of mobile-device use before and while crossing the road, we will foster more attentive pedestrian crossings.

From analyzing human behaviour in hundreds of collisions, I can tell you that the reality is that in many pedestrian/vehicle collisions, the pedestrian often has the last opportunity to avoid impact, simply because they can change their direction and speed much more quickly than the approaching vehicle. Deterring pedestrians from focusing on a device in front of their faces should allow more of them to take advantage of these opportunities when they are presented.
<h2><strong>If it walks like a duck…</strong></h2>
A defining feature of zombies is their slow and shuffling gait pattern. There is truth to this myth! Research has shown that pedestrians walk more slowly when engaged in distractive tasks (like talking) than if they walk without engaging in distraction.[3]Believe it or not, walking requires cognitive resources (i.e., brain power) and the more disengaged you are in the task of walking, the slower you will move. Some folks will even come to a complete stop.[4] We have all witnessed these oddities of pedestrian behaviour. If you haven’t, you will soon.

The relevance of walking speed is high when related to pedestrian crossings. It is logical that roadway crossings are inherently dangerous because they are a place of mutual conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. Simply put, the more time that pedestrians spend on the road, the more likely they are to be in conflict with vehicles. Unfortunately, crossing signal timings do not yet include a ‘zombie mode’ to increase protected pedestrian crossing time for those simultaneously swiping right, leaving the slowest of slow on the roadway for too long and at the mercy of the vehicle operator and prevailing environmental conditions.

The dangers of distracted drivers and pedestrians are real. But for all you zombies out there, the path to new life is clear; focus on walking instead of other distractions when crossing the road. Your health, and (possibly sooner rather than later) your wallet, will thank you.

		<title><![CDATA[Hazards of Adjusting]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Discover an environmental hazard while adjusting a loss? You’d better report it.</strong>

Property losses make up a large portion of files that end up as insurance claims, often requiring the involvement of multiple parties to return the insured property to a pre-loss state, including insurers, engineers, and contractors. Fundamentally, under the terms of Ontario Regulation (O.Reg.) 297/13—Occupational Health and Safety Awareness and Training, failure to make parties aware of hazards and hazardous materials can be deemed as an offence chargeable under the act. In an insurance context, this obligation to disclose may well flow through to adjusters, contractors and their organizations more broadly. Understanding the requirements is critical, therefore, for all parties in the safe and proper execution of both simple and complex files.

<strong>REPORTING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS</strong>

<img class=" wp-image-2020 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/MDRArticle3.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="137" />When dealing with property losses in Ontario, many aspects of the Ontario Building Code, Electrical Code, Fire Code and Municipal By-Laws drive the assessment and reinstatement phases. The environmental aspect of a loss should be an important consideration at the onset of the assessment phase, especially if any portion of the project will be tendered. Section 30 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) outlines the following duties of project owners regardless of the urgency, be it a planned or emergency situation:

• Before beginning a project, the owner shall determine whether any designated substances are present at the project site and shall prepare a list of all designated substances at the site.

• If any work on a project is tendered, the person issuing the tenders shall include, as part of the tendering information, a copy of the designated substances assessment.

• The owner shall ensure that a prospective constructor of a project on the owner’s property has received a copy of the designated substance assessment.

• The owner who fails to comply with Section 30 is liable to the constructor and every contractor who suffers any loss or damages as the result of the subsequent discovery on the project of a designated substance that the owner ought reasonably to have known of but that not listed in the designated substance report.

In Ontario, designated substances are defined by O.Reg. 490/09 and include acrylonitrile, arsenic, asbestos, benzene, coke oven emissions, ethylene oxide, isocyanates, lead, mercury, silica and vinyl chloride.

In addition, O.Reg. 278/05—Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings and Repair Operations requires that an asbestos survey be completed to identify the type of material that contains asbestos, the type of asbestos presence, the location within the building, and the condition of the asbestos-containing material. This applies to residential buildings with more than four units.

O. Reg 278/05 also makes clear the owner’s responsibility to have an asbestos survey completed prior to arranging or contracting for the demolition, alteration, or repair of all or part of machinery, equipment, building, aircraft, locomotive, railway car, vehicle or ship, even if no tenders are requested.

The procedure for installing some friable asbestos-containing materials (materials that can be crushed to a powder by hand pressure) has been banned. But be aware that regulations still permit the installation of non-friable asbestos-containing materials (materials that cannot be crushed to a powder by hand).

Regulations require the constructor to inform the Ministry of Labour when some specific types of asbestos abatement work procedures are to be followed due to disturbance of asbestos-containing materials. The notification to the Ministry of Labour is known as a Notice of Project, as outlined in O.Reg. 213/91—Regulation for Construction Projects. When the total cost of a project’s labour and materials is expected to exceed $50,000, or when a part of the permanent or temporary work is required to be designed by a professional engineer, a Notice of Project is required.

<img class="wp-image-2016 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/MDRArticle1.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="180" />One significant way non-compliance with OHSA requirements can occur on a property claim is after a Notice of Project has been made and the workplace in the building undergoes a Ministry of Labour (MOL) inspection. MOL inspectors show up to a building unannounced and must be granted access to all areas. An inspector will likely check that all documentation under the OHSA is in place and will then proceed to inspect the workplace to determine its compliance with the OHSA and regulations.

If an inspector identifies non-compliance with the OHSA, several enforcement tools are available. An inspector may issue compliance orders, stop work orders, tickets under the Provincial Offences Act, or can initiate prosecution for non-compliance. These orders can be directed towards either the owner or the constructor and can bring an entire claim to a halt until the orders are complied with.

The orders can negatively impact the relationship between the owner and the constructor, as owners can have different levels of involvement in the loss and little or no knowledge of their duties under the OHSA. Both aforementioned issues can complicate the execution and resolution of a property claim. A common non-compliance item associated with non-commercial residential buildings with more than four dwellings is the lack of asbestos surveys for management purposes and a lack of designated substance surveys for previous renovations.

<strong>WHAT ADJUSTERS MUST DO</strong>

How do all of the above acts, regulations and inspection procedures directly impact the adjuster, specifically?

On a property loss claim, it is in the insurance adjuster’s best interest, in conjunction with the constructor and engineers on the claim, to ensure that the owner provides any OHSA-required documents that are already available.

Assessment of loss-related areas can reveal an owner’s non-compliance with several aspects of the OHSA and can reveal that the compliance lies outside of the coverage of insurance policies, which can leave the owner responsible for the associated costs.

The adjuster, the constructor, and/ or the engineers should ensure that the owner is in receipt of any assessment documents that contain recommendations relating to OHSA; this information should not be concealed from the owner. In addition, the constructor should provide proof of disposal — bills of lading, weigh bills, etc. — of designated substances to the adjuster and the owner, since the owner is responsible for the designated substances from the point substances leave the building or property until they reach an appropriate disposal site.

The OHSA referenced above is applicable only to the province of Ontario, but each province administers its own act, designated substances regulations, and hazardous materials regulations. There are differences among the provinces, though many do require surveys for specific designated substances or hazardous materials as part of a renovation project, under which a property loss falls.

All parties involved in assessment and remediation of property losses needs to be aware of their duties under the law, as well as the associated rules, so that they can best protect themselves personally as well as legally.

		<title><![CDATA[Human versus Machine: Self-driving vehicles could benefit by behaving more like the humans they're trying to replace]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Who is to blame when a human operator could have performed better than their self-driving car?</strong></h2>
The recent fatal collision involving a late model SUV outfitted with autonomous driving technology has raised questions about the safety and readiness of the technology for today’s roads. While there are both technical and ethical questions stemming from this unfortunate event, paramount among them is whether a human driver could have performed better than the vehicle itself. Specifically, the question of whether a human driver could have avoided this collision or reduced its severity (and the likelihood of a fatal outcome) may have a substantial bearing on the forthcoming litigation that may arise from this and similar events, as well as the future of the technologies in general.

At present, little information has been released surrounding the collision circumstances. However, with what is currently available, it is possible to consider the expected behaviour of a human operator exposed to the collision scenario.

<em>What follows is a preliminary assessment of driver behaviour and collision avoidance under certain hypothetical conditions not verified through direct observation or review of privileged incident-related documentation. The reader should not interpret this article to be an investigation of actual collision circumstances. -30- has not been involved in the collision investigation.</em>
<h2><strong>The Collision</strong></h2>
The collision occurred on March 18, 2018, in the northbound curb lane on Mill Avenue in Tempe, Arizona, under nighttime conditions (Figure 1). Onboard video camera footage from the autonomous vehicle captured the collision and the moments preceding it (see the embedded video, below). The female pedestrian was walking a bicycle in an eastbound direction (from the driver’s left to right), wearing blue jeans and a black top. The bicycle had a red frame, with no obvious reflectorized materials visible (Figure 2).

<h3><strong><em>Onboard video of the collision</em></strong></h3>
The human operator in the vehicle was not actively engaged in the task of driving. The video appears to show the driver looking down and to their right as opposed to forward toward the roadway for a significant period of time prior to impact. The vehicle did not appear to autonomously engage in evasive action (such as hard braking or steering) prior to impact, indicating a complete failure to react to the pedestrian. The initial impact appeared to occur to the right of the vehicle centreline.

<strong><em>Figure 2: Screenshot of the onboard forward-facing video camera showing the pedestrian and bicycle moments prior to impact.</em></strong>
<h2><strong>Human Intervention</strong></h2>
To understand how the response of an attentive human operator would have differed from what actually happened, we need to assess the time and distance relationships between the involved vehicle and pedestrian. In other words, we need to determine how the involved vehicle and pedestrian came together on the roadway, and their respective travel speeds and directions to the point of impact.

Given the information available, some assumptions can be made for a hypothetical assessment of this event. For the pedestrian, let’s assume that she was walking her bike at an average speed for adult females of about 1.3 metres per second (m/s) [1]. For the vehicle, we will assume that it was travelling at the speed limit of 45 miles per hour, or 72 kilometres per hour (km/h).

Given these assumptions, what was an attentive human driver capable of when approaching the pedestrian under these conditions?

Drivers will take evasive action to avoid collisions by hard braking and/or steering only when it is obvious that a collision is imminent. Under nighttime conditions, a human operator should consider the approaching pedestrian as an obvious hazard when she was first observed nearing the lane of the northbound SUV, and when the pedestrian was sufficiently illuminated to allow for her detection.

The first step to understanding a human response to a pedestrian is to determine when they can first be seen. Under nighttime conditions, roadway streetlight and vehicle headlights are the primary factors that limit what drivers can observe on the roadway. Review of the onboard video footage from the incident event indicated that there were active streetlights on both sides of the roadway near the collision location (Figure 3). However, it is not possible to determine the extent to which these streetlights allowed for a driver’s visibility of the pedestrian because the video footage was likely not calibrated to represent what the human eye could see under the same lighting conditions.
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHfPT9HwSfkLw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=2129500800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=pVlvrLe5-mbEIE8lb0_nLb6QnhHEH4RP59gka8bJMqU" /></div>
<strong><em>Figure 3: Screenshot of the onboard forward-facing video camera moments prior to impact depicting the streetlights near the collision site.</em></strong>

To determine the distance at which the driver could first observe the pedestrian, it can be assumed that the sole light sources in the area were the low-beam headlights of the SUV. This assumption provides for the worst-case scenario for the driver by assuming the streetlights made no contribution at all. Based on the lighting for new bulbs in the involved SUV, a pedestrian dressed in dark grey clothing would be detectable by an approaching driver when the vehicle and pedestrian were 53 metres and 3.4 metres away from the impact location, respectively.

Upon detecting the pedestrian, a period of time elapses before a driver can engage in evasive action. This time is known as the ‘perception and response’ interval, which encompasses the time needed for the driver to process and interpret the visual information, select a response (brake and/or steer) and then execute the evasive maneuver. From the moment that the pedestrian was first observed as a hazard, it is expected that an ‘average’ driver would initiate evasive action within 1.5 seconds [2].
<h2><strong>What does it all mean?</strong></h2>
Considering the hypothetical scenario detailed above, this analysis approach suggests that a driver in the northbound SUV would be expected to begin evasive action prior to impact, initiating braking/steering when the vehicle was approximately 23 metres away from the impact location. Under full braking, the SUV could have been slowed to approximately 23 km/h by the time it reached impact, with 1.8 seconds of braking [3].

This braking may have allowed for two alternative outcomes. First, braking by a human operator could have allowed the pedestrian to pass in front of the vehicle and avoid impact altogether. Damage to the SUV was reportedly sustained to its right front, meaning the pedestrian only needed to travel slightly less than half of the vehicle’s width (i.e., less than 1 metre) to clear the path of the SUV and avoid the collision [4]. The amount of braking expected of a human operator would delay the vehicle’s arrival by approximately 0.6 seconds. This additional time would allow the pedestrian to travel an additional 0.8 metres, which may have delayed the vehicle’s arrival just enough for the pedestrian to have cleared the vehicle’s path.
<blockquote>Braking by a human operator could have allowed the pedestrian to pass in front of the vehicle and avoid impact altogether.</blockquote>
A second possible outcome is that the collision may still have occurred, but if so, at a significantly lower impact speed. Had a human operator detected the pedestrian and braked (as expected), the SUV could have slowed to about 23 km/h. At this speed, a fatal outcome would not be expected. A 2011 review article [5] estimates the probability of a fatal outcome at less than 5% for impact speeds up to 25 km/h. Further, research suggests that the likelihood of a serious injury outcome (requiring hospitalization) is less than 15% for an impact speed of 25 km/h or less [6].
<blockquote>A fatal outcome would not be expected if a typical human operated the vehicle.</blockquote>
To summarize, if the human operator was attentive, and responded in a typical fashion with emergency-level braking, it is unlikely that the pedestrian would have sustained a fatal outcome. Moreover, the likely severity of the pedestrian’s injuries would have been significantly reduced.
<h2><strong>Food for Thought</strong></h2>
The point of autonomous driving technology is to remove the human element from the driving ecosystem. As a by-product of these technologies, the potential for human intervention in critical collision situations is significantly and purposefully limited. Of course, the overarching expectation is that the hazard detection technology onboard an autonomous vehicle would identify a pedestrian or any other hazard earlier than a human operator could, and react more quickly, preventing more collisions. However, the very real outcome of this impact raises difficult questions for developers of autonomous driving technology to answer.

This recent event demonstrates that, while autonomous vehicles permit human inattention to the driving task, they are still unable to perform to the level of human capacity in certain situations. One is left wondering about how the question of blame will be handled when a human operator could have performed better than a self-driving car.

		<title><![CDATA[Segmental Retaining Wall Failures]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Segmental retaining walls (SRWs) or modular block retaining walls have gained popularity over the years as a soil retention technique because of their economy and speed of installation, the flexibility of geometric configuration, and the variety of blocks available in the market to suit a project’s architectural and aesthetic requirements (Figure 1). SRWs can also tolerate much larger post-construction settlements compared to conventional reinforced concrete retaining walls.
<h5>Figure 1 – Example applications of SRW systems</h5>

Depending on wall height and individual block dimensions, stacks of these blocks may form the primary retaining component themselves as a ‘gravity’ retaining wall (Figure 2), or may serve as the facing blocks of a larger retaining wall system that is mechanically reinforced with geosynthetics or metal strips (Figure 3). The latter type is commonly known as Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls which have been widely used in the last three or four decades in various land development and transportation applications.  Locally, the Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO) has designated such systems as Retained Soil Systems (RSS)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.

<h6><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Not to be confused with the same acronym for ‘Reinforced Soil Slopes’ as adopted by the Federal Highway Administration in the USA for MSE walls that are flatter than 70 degrees from the horizontal.</h6>
Many SRWs are proprietary systems. The manufacturer or supplier of these SRW blocks typically provide generic design drawings, specifications and installation manuals accompanying their products. The design and installation recommendations of most manufacturers follow the guidelines published by the National Concrete Masonry Association (NCMA)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> or the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> of the USA.

While SRWs have been used in small, ‘do-it-yourself’ landscaping applications, the Ontario Building Code requires any retaining wall greater than 1 m in height to be designed by a Professional Engineer. The design and construction of SRWs, especially the MSE type, can be quite an involved process. Because of the proprietary nature of these systems, confusion often arises as to who the designer/engineer-of-record of the system is and how different parties should interact throughout the planning, design and construction process. While public agencies such as the Ministry of Transportation Ontario has established guidelines, quality control and review procedures for the design and construction of these systems, the private sector projects (e.g., SRWs supporting residential, commercial or industrial backyards, driveways and parking lots) often do not benefit from adequate technical, administrative and project management oversight.

Our experience investigating failure or excessive movement of these SRWs indicates an inadequate understanding of the planning, design and construction process leading to frequent insurance and legal claims. This article describes two case histories about SRW/MSE wall performance in Ontario, with project details withheld for confidentiality reasons. The scope of the discussion presented here applies to SRWs or MSE walls more than 1 m in height that require design by a Professional Engineer. The focus of this article is not on the technical details of design and construction that led to damage or damage mechanisms, but on the underlying shortcomings in the design, construction or procurement process that lead to damage and claims.

<strong>Case History 1</strong>: The project involved tiered or terraced MSE walls with modular block facings, located behind a multi-story residential building. The site topography made for challenging design and construction conditions with an overall retained soil height on the order of 25 m. The owner of the project commissioned a geotechnical investigation when the project was at a conceptual design stage. The final design and construction of the retaining walls were completed some 10 years later. The prime consultant/civil engineer retained by the owner designed the site layout and grading, including the alignment and number of retaining wall tiers. The general contractor for the project was tasked with selecting a SRW supplier. The wall supplier, in turn, retained an external consulting firm to act as the wall designer. Throughout the design process, the original geotechnical investigation firm was not involved, neither was any other geotechnical investigation firm. During construction, the owner hired a second geotechnical consulting firm to provide geotechnical quality assurance services.

The wall was constructed over a winter season. Immediately following the completion of construction, the wall started experiencing excessive vertical and horizontal movements which eventually necessitated partial removal of the retaining walls as a safety measure.

<strong>Case History 2</strong>: This project incorporated SRWs at the corner of a parking lot at a commercial storage facility. The wall height was relatively shallow with an exposed wall height of up to 1.5 m. The owner of the project retained a civil engineer and an architect to design the site layout as well as site grading and services plan. The owner also hired a geotechnical engineer to complete a geotechnical investigation for the site development. The general contractor was tasked with selecting a SRW supplier. A proprietary SRW system was selected; however, none of the parties retained a wall designer. The contractor installed the wall reportedly following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The civil engineer or the geotechnical engineer were not involved in design review or construction inspections for the SRW.

Approximately one year after the completion of construction, large sinkholes formed in the retained pavement surface immediately behind the retaining wall following a heavy rainstorm. The sinkholes extended down to the base of the walls.  The embedment in front of the wall was eroded, exposing the bottom blocks and leading to erosion of the compacted base, and undermining portions of the wall.

These case histories typify some common traits that plague the private-sector applications of these retaining wall systems, as follows:

<strong>-</strong>The design process and division of responsibility for checking various aspects of design is not clearly understood

<strong>-</strong>The design completed by the wall designer is not checked by the owner’s geotechnical engineer and the prime design consultant/civil designer

<strong>-</strong>The contractor is given the responsibility of retaining a wall supplier and designer

<strong>-</strong>The block manufacturer or supplier’s generic design is used as final design

As mentioned before, these systems warrant a co-ordinated and interdependent design effort among the various parties. Per best practice in the industry, the wall designer, or engineer-of-record, is responsible for checking both the ‘external’ and ‘internal’ stabilities. The external stability checks include the classic modes of failure for retaining walls – sliding, overturning, bearing capacity. Additionally, reinforced SRW or MSE walls require checks on internal stability (reinforcement fracture, pullout and connection strength with the facing blocks). The owner’s geotechnical engineer should check for global stability<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and suitability of site soil parameters assumed by the wall designer. For special geometries (e.g., tiered systems), these walls also require a design check for ‘compound’ failure mode<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>. There has been some debate in the industry, however, about who should be responsible for compound stability check (wall designer or geotechnical engineer), as well as internal drainage design for these systems, as discussed during a recent expert panel discussion on MSE wall design in Toronto<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>.

Finally, the project civil engineer is responsible for coordinating the efforts of all parties and ensuring integration of the wall design with the overall site grading, servicing and drainage plan. Depending on the contracting arrangement and level of expertise, the civil engineer can also act as the wall designer in some cases.

Regarding current procurement practices with the contractor retaining the wall designer similar to a design-build arrangement, the NCMA advocates the alternative of having the owner engage the services of a wall designer to keep design and construction roles separate and avoid potential conflicts of interest. While large public sector projects often benefit from design-build arrangements, recent experience with privately owned SRW projects support a direct contractual relationship between the owner and the wall designer to best protect the interests of the owner, and reduce the number of losses related to the failure of these systems.

Regarding the misconceptions surrounding the wall manufacturer’s role, it is important to be aware that the manufacturer typically provides only general design drawings and installation guidelines accompanying their products. These documents should not be used for final design without modification to suit site-specific conditions and without the aforementioned multi-stage review process. Unless specifically retained to do so, the manufacturer usually does not take responsibility for a site-specific design.

The Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) published a document in July 2017 titled “Design, Construction, Maintenance and Inspection Guide for Mechanically Stabilized Earth Walls” which should serve as a useful reference for project owners and their consultants, both in the public and private sectors, to manage the performance of SRW systems throughout the lifecycle of these structures. The TAC reference should provide a local perspective and complement the information previously available through the aforementioned US agencies.

In conclusion, SRW systems offer versatility, economy and durability in meeting a site’s grading requirements. However, a lack of understanding of the design and construction responsibilities often lead to physical damage of these systems.  The resulting insurance and legal claims can take considerable effort to resolve due to the complexity of the contributing factors and, as such, can significantly delay a project’s schedule or hamper the operations of a facility. The onus ultimately lies with the project owners and their prime design consultants to understand and manage the design, construction and maintenance of these systems.

		<title><![CDATA[Are Hurt People Injured?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[In the 10 years I have been working in the forensics field, two of the questions I am most commonly asked are:
<ol>
 	<li>Could this collision have resulted in an injury?</li>
 	<li>Can the forces of this collision explain the reported complaints?</li>
</ol>
While these questions appear to be the same, those involved with personal injury litigation know that they are very different. In the first instance, the question is whether a collision (or any event, such as a slip and fall or product failure) would have put enough force on the body to damage the tissues. The second is asking whether the same event could result in an individual reporting subjective complaints such as pain.

<img class=" wp-image-2155 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOArticle2.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="158" />Biomechanics is a unique area of study. Unlike other biological fields, such as botany or molecular biology, we cannot ethically grow a group of homogenous test subjects and control for things like age, diet, activity, and genetic make-up. Dealing with people means we have to accept a certain amount of inherent variability, yet it provides for some of the most interesting problem-solving and advanced investigation. Due to our inability to constantly monitor the forces applied to the body and the body’s response to each event, we must draw conclusions using measurements that are easier to obtain. In the field of biomechanics, one such measurement is pain. Pain can be used as a simple metric (rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being none and 10 being the worst imaginable) to understand outcomes like injury, exertion levels, and fatigue.

However, pain is not a perfect indicator of injury, as it is possible to have pain in the absence of injury. In 2001, researchers wanted to better understand the relationship between a rear-end collision and the reporting of symptoms, without the intervening collision forces and any potential for injury.[1] What they did was establish a ‘placebo’ impact. For those unfamiliar, placebo treatments in research are used to mask whether someone is actually receiving an intervention, to make sure that any observed response cannot simply be attributed to the act of receiving that intervention.

For example, if we want to know how effective a drug was in battling headaches, we would randomly assign people to a test group or a placebo group. Both groups would know they were participating in a study to assess the effects of the medication on headaches, but the test group would receive the drug, while the placebo group would receive a ‘sham treatment,’ such as a sugar pill. This test set-up would allow for an analysis of whether people report improvements in their headache symptoms simply from being included in the study, despite the fact they are not actually receiving any intervention. Accounting for a ‘placebo effect’ provides researchers greater confidence that their intervention was the cause of a change, such as a reduction in headache symptoms.

<img class=" wp-image-2157 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOArticle3.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="164" />So how do you create a placebo collision? In this case, participants were seated in a vehicle and led to believe their vehicle would be rear-ended by another vehicle. To prevent the participants from anticipating the collision and bracing for impact, which could alter the outcome, the vehicle was shrouded so they could not see the approaching car. The striking vehicle was driven towards the stationary vehicle containing the participants, and the brakes were applied prior to impact to generate braking sounds. The participant’s vehicle was equipped with a weight system that would drop and smash a glass bottle when the brakes of the approaching car were applied to create the sound of glass breaking. A debris field was placed behind the participant’s car. The test vehicle was then gently rolled down a small 6-centimetre incline to create the effects of moving forward. In this way, the participants experienced gentle motion but heard the sounds and saw the debris and damage associated with a rear-end collision. The gentle motion applied would in no way cause injury.

While the study design was unique, the outcomes were even more interesting. The authors found that, immediately after the collision, 9 of the 51 participants (33 males and 18 females; average age of 32.4 years) reported symptoms including fright, neck stiffness, dizziness, palpitations, and low back burning. In this way, 18% of the participants who had not been involved in a collision immediately reported the symptoms commonly seen after low-speed rear impact collisions and attributed them directly to the placebo impact.

To gather more information, the authors followed these participants over a period of time. Within one to three days, 10 more participants (8 males and 2 females) reported symptoms including neck pain, nausea, shoulder pain, vomiting, tinnitus, headache, and fatigue. Only three of these participants initially reported pain immediately after the collision. In days 4 to 28 after the placebo collision, three participants still continued to complain of symptoms they attributed to the collision. Symptoms appeared between zero and five days after the placebo event, and in one case lasted more than four weeks. Recall that no one had actually experienced a collision, they only thought they had.

It’s not my intention to downplay the risk of injury in motor vehicle collisions. Injuries can and do happen. In fact, the authors of the above study opined that “<em>it is clear from our study that accident victims may quite honestly believe they have been physically injured in a low-velocity collision even when they have not been injured.</em>”

The difficulty faced by biomechanists in assessing the cause of an injury due to an event lies in the need to rely on data where injury is not measured or observable, but pain is. This same difficulty also exists for medical professionals providing opinions on the relationship between a collision and someone’s complaints, particularly when they have no knowledge of the forces of an event.

This is why a biomechanical assessment of injury causation can’t rely solely on the frequency with which symptoms are reported. It must consider the movement, accelerations, and forces acting on the body along with what the tissues can withstand prior to damage occurring. Only in pairing the subjective measurements of injury, such as pain, with objective measurements (as obtained from cadavers and test dummies) can reliable conclusions be drawn.

I end by stating that I am a biomechanist and not a pain expert. I cannot know why those exposed to placebo collisions reported this constellation of symptoms. What I do know is that they experienced almost no force on their body, and they therefore could not have been injured.

		<title><![CDATA[Convenience at a Cost: Autonomous Vehicles are not (yet) what they seem]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Leading automotive manufacturers and technology developers have made exceptional advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, but they have not yet achieved what has been promised to, or expected by, the consumer.

In flashy marketing campaigns and social blasts, we have been sold a bill of goods that autonomous vehicles are not yet able to deliver. Believe it or not, autonomous vehicles cannot (yet) drop your kids off at school and drive you to work while you sleep. While some manufacturers and their technologies provide certain functionality to its consumers, they vary wildly in capability and design. What you get when you buy an autonomous vehicle may not be what you think.

<img class=" wp-image-2172 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Autonomous1.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="247" />Autonomous vehicles are classified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) by ‘levels’ that equate to the amount of self-driving the vehicle will do for you<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. Level 0 means that there is zero automation and that the driver is entirely responsible for all primary vehicle controls (braking, steering, throttle, etc.). One step up is Level 1, in which automation of specific tasks is possible, such as speed monitoring in a manner comparable to cruise control. At the extreme end is Level 5, in which the vehicle itself will perform all safety-critical driving functions with no human input whatsoever.

Present-day commercially-available autonomous vehicles have achieved Level 3 autonomy. This means that the driver can hand-over full control to the autonomous system <em>only</em> under certain driving conditions, such as mundane highway driving, but not when more complex navigation is required such as through a construction zone. However, even when in the allowable situations, the driver must be ready to retake control of the vehicle at any given time.

The irony of requiring humans to operate self-driving vehicles aside, the reliance on driver intervention when operating autonomous vehicles presents new challenges to drivers themselves and in assessing the cause(s) of accidents when they occur.

<strong><u>Is driving, driving anymore?</u></strong>

Driving is a skill like any other in that it takes time to learn and master. Yet, the battery of tasks involved with driving are changing because of the advancement of autonomous technologies, which is increasing the proportion of unsuitably skilled motorists on the roadway every time an autonomous vehicle rolls off the lot.

When driving, drivers are expected to perform navigational tasks such as speed and lane control, and to scan the roadway ahead for potential or emergent hazards. While doing so, drivers are also expected to have their feet in the foot well and hands on the steering wheel. By consistently applying these practices and postures, drivers become conditioned to a set of predicable and repeatable behaviours when behind the wheel.

Consider the example of encountering a jaywalking pedestrian on the roadway. While driving a traditional (non-autonomous) vehicle, the driver is tasked with observing the pedestrian, assessing whether its path will cross that of the vehicle, determining whether evasive action (braking and/or steering) is required then, if needed, taking such action to avoid a collision. This and related situations are common to the typical driver experience.

Now consider that the driver is approaching the same pedestrian but is instead behind the wheel of an autonomous vehicle in self-driving mode. How is the situation different?

For one, the driver is not driving. What is the consequence of this? If not actively involved in the task of driving, drivers may not be attentive to the roadway and potential hazards ahead. Their hands and feet may not be on the steering wheel and pedals. Think of what YOU would be doing in the car if it was taking care of the driving.

Under these conditions, ‘drivers’ of modern-day autonomous vehicles face an inherently different set of challenges to operate these vehicles safely, particularly when the vehicle indicates that the driver must retake control. Re-engaging in the task of driving can be met with differing behaviour, requiring differing amounts of time to complete, depending on what occupants are doing beforehand.

When in self-driving mode and approaching a roadway section where drivers must takeback control of the vehicle, autonomous vehicles will provide signals and cues to the driver. For an effective hand-over to the human occupant, self-driving vehicles must provide warning <em>“with sufficiently comfortable transition time”</em><sup>1</sup>, yet that is an idealized scenario. In situations when the hazard detection technology (LIDAR, radar, sonar, etc.) are delayed in, or entirely miss, detecting roadway obstacles or challenging conditions, this ‘comfortable’ timeframe may morph into something much more urgent. Under pressure, humans generally perform poorly compared to when time to plan and execute a response is plentiful. In a well-known phenomenon of the ‘speed-accuracy trade-off’, the faster you try to perform a task, the less accurate you will be<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. Stated differently, you are more prone to make errors when trying to perform tasks faster than you typically would.

This problem is magnified when a driver is warned to re-engage at a time when they are distracted or not properly seated in the driver’s seat. The subsequent rush to get back to the ten-and-two position on the steering wheel with the feet properly on the pedals, all while having to reorient themselves of their surroundings and any roadway hazards, may be a tall order for some. Even when manually operating non-autonomous vehicles, drivers can miss the brake pedal in the panic of attempting to avoid a collision<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, with such errors in driver response having catastrophic consequences. The likelihood for delayed response, misplacement of the hands and feet, and poor decision making only increases when retaking control of autonomous vehicles.

<strong><u>Case in point</u></strong>

<img class=" wp-image-2175 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Autonomous3-1.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="367" />The adverse interaction between drivers and their self-driving vehicle is best exemplified by a recent collision event that occurred between Tesla and a firetruck. Briefly, a Tesla reportedly operating in autonomous mode collided with a firetruck stopped on the shoulder of a highway<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>.  On the surface, this incident may seem to be caused by a technical malfunction or algorithmic glitch which failed to avoid an obvious roadway hazard. But, it may not be that simple. Tesla states in its own reporting on the matter that <em>“it is</em> [the driver’s] <em>responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times”</em>, and that drivers must <em>“always watch the road in front… and be prepared to take corrective action at all times”</em> <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>. These expectations of driver engagement stand in remarkable contrast to the expectations of self-driving vehicle capabilities. That being said, did the driver understand their responsibility or the capabilities of the vehicle? Had they been exposed to the warnings or other cues provided by the vehicle to prompt the driver to act? Was the severity of the hazard understood by the driver? Did they try to re-engage and mis-fire under pressure to do so? These and a host of other questions remain unanswered, yet are critical to understanding the cause of this and related collisions.

Calling vehicles ‘autonomous’ yet requiring driver intervention is both ironic and dangerously misleading. To overcome the void between expectations of vehicle capabilities and the reality of their shortcomings, we may be approaching a world in which drivers must carefully read their vehicle’s manual before ever driving it. Or, drivers may need to be formally trained in the use of the vehicle’s technology. Without training or education by those with expertise in the technology’s use, capabilities and limitations, our misconceptions formed by media and advertising will be the guiding force of our understanding of the technology at our fingertips and perhaps our excuse for not doing more to avoid a collision threat.

<strong><u>Practice…we’re talking about practice?</u></strong>

As with any skill, we improve with practice. But how much practice is required before a driver can properly use autonomous driving technology? At present, autonomous vehicle operators are under no obligation to demonstrate minimum levels of competency with the technology—there are simply no mandatory tests or minimum thresholds to prove a driver’s familiarity or skill in its use. The effect is that some users of autonomous vehicles may be highly under-skilled, and yet the only barrier to purchasing an autonomous vehicle is a financial one.

<img class=" wp-image-2173 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Autonomous2.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="262" />This raises a vitally important point: the task of driving is changing, yet the testing of driver skill and competency has not. As technological advancement surges on, governments and agencies responsible for ensuring roadway safety and driver training should consider the effect that self-driving vehicles have on human factors and skill development.

Human performance research is full of anecdotes and hardcore science which collectively indicate that mastering skill takes time and practice. In other words, the more you drive, the better you generally get at the task of driving. Drilling deeper into the performance gains with driving experience, what you find is that drivers become better able to monitor the roadway for potential hazards before they become unavoidable collision threats<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>. In other words, what a naïve and inexperienced driver would see as a benign event, or not see at all, an experienced driver would identify as posing a potential problem and take anticipatory action. In the most traditional sense, practice and experience with driving helps drivers avoid more accidents.

However, practice with self-driving vehicles creates an entirely different picture. Unlike with conventional vehicles, extended exposure to autonomous vehicles re-enforces habits and behaviours that stand in remarkable contradiction to roadway safety. Highly advanced self-driving technologies foster inattention and distraction to a continually greater degree as drivers become more confident with the system’s abilities. Trusting the technology more and more to properly perform the task of driving breeds inattention and distraction, which is further proliferated over time<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. The end game is a host of occupants sleeping behind the wheel at just the moment the vehicle requires the driver to re-engage. A sobering thought.

<strong><u>Who (or what) caused the collision?</u></strong>

When vehicles are involved in collisions, investigators turn to human factors research to understand what drivers are expected to do when confronted with collision threats. The science behind expected (human) driver behaviour is well-established in various situations. However, the most established science assumes that the driver is, well, driving.

When an autonomous vehicle is involved in a collision, understanding what the human occupant should or could have done to avoid the collision depends on another host of variables not yet held to the same level of scientific scrutiny. This is because independent research has not been able to keep up with the pace of technological advancement or the array of options and models of the technology being produced by manufacturers: every manufacturer is left to develop and validate their autonomous technology for themselves. The research behind proprietary technology occurs behind closed doors, creating a siloed ecosystem of knowledge that may not be transferable across different makes and models of the technology.

To highlight the challenge of assessing expected driver behaviour, consider again the example of an autonomous vehicle in self-driving mode approaching a roadway hazard, and assume that the hazard is acutely visible and detectable to the human occupant. For a hazard visible to the human occupant, it may not be a stretch for them to assume that the advanced technology contained in their vehicle would ‘see’ the hazard as well. Wouldn’t you think that the technology was at least capable of doing what a human could do? If the self-driving vehicle has successfully avoided collisions with similar hazards in the past, wouldn’t you think that it would do so again? Confronted with this situation, drivers trust of their vehicle’s capability to respond to roadway obstacles may result in them delaying or avoiding taking evasive action themselves.

When approaching a potential collision hazard in an autonomous vehicle, the question of what the driver should have done is no longer focused on when the driver was able to detect and respond to the roadway hazard directly. Rather, it is related to when the driver recognized that their <em>vehicle</em> did not detect and respond to the roadway hazard as expected. This seemingly subtle distinction is critical to assessing fault and cause of collisions. The driver’s behaviour in a critical situation is directly related to the expectation of their vehicle’s performance, likely influenced and re-enforced by previous successful trips without human intervention. Absence of response by the human occupant may in fact be a manifestation of trust in technology rather than inattention or distraction.

The legal and insurance industries tasked with assessing liability in collision events are no doubt going to be confronted with matters involving driverless vehicles and their occupants. The tests for whether a collision should have been avoided or not, and who or what is at fault, will range among technological, human and their interactive effects. Even though some manufacturers aim to pass ‘responsibility’ to the occupants of their self-driving vehicles, both the costs and benefits of the technology cannot be ignored.

<strong><u>Powering down</u></strong>

As most manufacturers and autonomous technology developers would have you believe, owning a fully autonomous vehicle would be the pinnacle of luxury—sleeping while commuting, socializing with passengers, or enjoying the scenery during long drives. But such convenience inevitably comes at a cost, one necessarily borne by today’s driver transitioning from a world of cars being driven to one of cars doing the driving.

The goal of autonomous vehicles is ultimately to remove humans from the equation and thereby make driving safer. But while transitioning from no autonomy to full autonomy, drivers are being quietly and in some cases unknowingly asked to do very different things from that which they are accustomed and trained to do. In this interim period, and as with any new technology, it is imperative to understand it first. At least for now, that is something that you must do for yourself.

		<title><![CDATA[Faro Focus: The Benefit of Precise 3D Documentation]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The Faro Focus is a compact 360 degree laser scanning device used for detailed measurement and documentation. It is able to capture and reproduce environments in 3D with colour in only a few minutes. The Faro Focus has an accuracy of up to 2mm and a range of focus of 0.6 to 330 metres. The Faro Focus essentially uses a laser to survey the coordinates (x,y,z) of millions of points in its range of focus (typically 7 million points per scan!). Due to the amount and density of points captured, the Faro Focus is able to recreate environments, to scale, in 3D. This is commonly referred to as a ‘point cloud’. The image below depicts a ‘point cloud’ in its raw form (millions of points) in contrast with a photo taken by the Faro Focus of the same data. The photos taken by the Faro Focus contain 3D information and any position visible in the photo can be translated to a 3D coordinate.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2212" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Image1.jpg" alt="" width="1036" height="611" />
<strong><em>3D Survey Data Captured by the Faro Focus 3D</em></strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2213" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Image2.jpg" alt="" width="1052" height="601" />
<strong><em>Photo Taken by the Faro Focus 3D</em></strong>

The Faro Focus can be positioned at multiple stations to capture large environments. Essentially, a ‘chain’ of scan positions are referenced to each other to create one monolithic point cloud. This could include multiple levels or both sides of a specific subject. The image below depicts how the Faro Focus is able to capture multiple levels and rooms in a house.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2214" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Image3.jpg" alt="" width="1177" height="697" />
<em><strong>Section View of a Faro Focus Scan Project</strong></em>

The Faro Focus is able to reference multiple scan locations together through a special technology called ‘cloud to cloud referencing’. This technology essentially allows unique shapes, planes and features, visible in multiple scan positions, to connect to each other. Other options such as target referencing can also be used to reference scan positons together. This is done by using discreet targets, like benchmark points or special targets provided by Faro. Target referencing needs to be carefully planned and executed. It is crucial to have adequate references visible (unique cloud references or discreet targets) in multiple scan positions in order to create an accurate point cloud.

Other factors to keep in mind while scanning is the resolution and quality settings of the Faro Focus. These factors can be adjusted based on the desired level of accuracy and point cloud density. For instance, at a given resolution, the Faro Focus will take a different number of measurements. Essentially, the resolution controls the spacing of points at given distance. The higher the resolution, the more points which will be measured and thus the higher the density of the point cloud. The quality setting dictates the amount of ‘noise’ the scanner will allow. That is, how effective the scanner capturing every point on a surface needs to be. A high quality will force the scanner to take additional readings to ensure it captures the points. Essentially, quality makes the difference between an inefficient, fuzzy point cloud and a uniform, robust point cloud.

The resolution and quality settings affect the time of the scan. Scans can range from 30 seconds to 30 minutes – the higher the resolution and quality, the higher the scan time. These settings will depend on the desired information or type of analysis you wish to carry out. For instance, if you are scanning a large, open area you may wish to increase resolution so that you are able to capture a greater amount of points further away. This may because references are scarce or because you want to decrease the number of scans you need to carry out. If you are scanning a brand new, shiny black car you may want a higher quality to ensure all data is captured. Dark and reflective surfaces typically absorb the signal from the laser and so points are not recorded. Further, weather and environment conditions can affect the scans – best to hire a professional.

A little boring and a little confusing... the fun stuff is coming…

Once the survey has been carried out and the desired scan positions have been completed, the point cloud can be created. This can be done though many software applications and is when the cloud to cloud technology or target registration is carried out. The individual scan locations are compiled and the monolithic point cloud is ready for analysis. This is where the magic happens…

Point clouds can be used for a wide variety of applications ranging from accident reconstruction, architecture, excavation volumes, building construction, façade and structural deformations, complex geometry, forensics and manufacturing to shipbuilding (!!?!) – anybody dream of building their own pirate ship?  Analysis on the point cloud can be carried out using MANY software applications. Some software is better suited for specific types of analysis – again, best to hire a professional.

One common application for the Faro Focus is to document construction (structural and architectural). This allows for a powerful inspection of construction elements before finishing of the building. The data can also be used to investigate any structural deflections or deformations.  The image bellows depicts the alignment of a masonry wall – the colors represent the projection of each masonry unit. This same technique can be applied to deflections of steel beams or depressions in concrete slabs.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2215" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Image4.png" alt="" width="700" height="355" />
<strong><em>Surface Analysis of Masonry Wall</em></strong>

Another application in the construction industry is heritage documentation and restoration. The 3D data captured by the Faro can be used to facilitate the reconstruction of degraded historical components or for preservations purposes. City building department often require highly detailed drawings and documentation when working with designated heritage buildings. The image below reflects a project in which a façade restoration of a historical building was carried out. The Faro Focus was used to accurately capture all the required data to recreate the historical features. This same application can be used for other historical preservation efforts such as artifacts in museums or archeological discoveries.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2216" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Image5.jpg" alt="" width="1361" height="974" />
<strong><em>Front Façade Restoration of Heritage Building</em></strong>

<em>
</em>Another prominent application for the Faro Focus is Civil Engineering/Surveying. This can be very beneficial when trying to gather information from large or distant objects. Deformation of bridges, movement of large structures or shape changes can be easily captured by the Faro Focus. The image below shows the capability of the Faro Focus to capture the underside of the Gardiner Expressway. This information can be used to investigate and compare any changes in position. In addition to this type of surveying, the data can also be used to analyze volumes in barges, silos or warehouses. The Faro Focus can also be sued to survey as built conditions and ensure the constriction fits the design intent. The Faro Focus data can easily be tied into any survey data using available benchmarks or points of reference.

<strong><em>Faro Focus Scan of Gardiner Expressway (Toronto)</em></strong>

Building information modeling (BIM) is another application which is commonly carried out using point clouds. Almost any component of a building or manufacturing plant can be captured by the Faro Focus and deliver real world information to a BIM model. This can greatly assist in planning new pipe or duct runs as well as capturing quantity data for specific components of interest.

<strong>                           Duct Run Planning for New Electrical Bus Ducts</strong>

&nbsp;

A very popular application for the Faro Focus is surface analysis. This can be used for a wide variety of applications. Flood analysis, forensic investigation into slips, trips and falls and visibility assessments due to road crests etc. The image below represent the elevation banding surrounding a building. An investigation was carried out to understand if the building was endanger of flooding. The Faro Focus can greatly assist in creating surfaces, contours and sections of existing grades etc.

<strong><em>Visibility Assessment of Road Crest</em></strong>

<em> </em>

Accident reconstruction is also a prominent application of the Faro Focus. Again, point clouds can be used for a variety of application within the accident reconstruction industry. This includes visibility assessments due to obstructions such as trees or buildings at intersection corners and crush analysis of vehicles involved in accident to estimate speeds and impact orientation.

<strong><em>Section of Point Cloud showing Damaged Vehicle Profile</em></strong>

One final applications of the Faro Focus which will be touch upon here is photogrammetry. Although less prominent, photogrammetry using survey data is growing popularity and can be used across many industries. Essentially, 3D information can be pulled from photos by using survey data to ‘rectify’ the image and solve for the camera positon. Based on the solved camera position, objects and positions of points of interest can be pulled from the photographs. This is especially useful when objects have been captured in a photo but are no longer present. For instance, if a vehicle is in an accident and is no longer available for surveying, photos of the damaged vehicle can be used, along with scan data of an undamaged exemplar vehicle, to rectify crush profiles. This is done by linking the undamaged vehicle data to undamaged portions of the damaged vehicle. It’s a tricky process but can provide information once thought to be lost.

<strong><em>Crush Profile Taken from Damaged Vehicle Photo Using Exemplar Data</em></strong>

&nbsp;

At the end of the day, the Faro Focus is an extremely powerful tool that can be used for MANY applications. The technology is constantly growing and people are continuously finding new ways to apply the data that the Faro Focus is able to capture. The application of the data is up for interpretation and the benefit of precise 3D documentation in a fast and reliable manor, time savings, compelling representation and ease of analysis is undeniably going to play a huge part in the future of many industries.

Happy scanning!

		<title><![CDATA[A Multi-disciplinary Approach to an Explosive Situation]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Forensic investigators are both scientists and detectives, fueled by the commitment to pursue knowledge and the drive to successfully solve each case. Though a forensic investigator may specialize in areas as diverse as Building Science, Fire Investigation and Materials Failure, they all share the common goal of uncovering the true cause of an incident and making our world a safer place through sharing this information and empowering people to make informed decisions based in science. Work fulfillment is gained by confronting a challenging problem and finding a solution. It’s this problem solving in service of a greater good that drives a forensic investigator in their work.

But many loses are complex, and a single investigator, regardless of skill and commitment, cannot always reach a conclusion alone. Loses often involve multiple factors and require the expertise of more than one investigator to uncover origin and cause and develop practical solutions. In such cases, it is ideal to work within a team of specialists, with each investigator focusing their efforts in the area where they have deep understanding of the science involved, and the team combining their shared knowledge and experience to uncover the complete picture. It is this approach that will lead to conclusions on challenging cases and allow the forensic investigator to deliver useful solutions to clients.

One case involved an explosion in an industrial building. The explosion occurred on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of a 4-storey structure, and caused severe damage to one side of the building (Photograph 1). It was determined that the structural integrity and safety of the building had been compromised and immediate action was required to ensure safety in the areas at risk of structural collapse. An emergency response was necessary.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-2242" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Pablo3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="331" />       <img class="alignnone  wp-image-2243" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Pablo4.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="330" />

<strong>Photograph 1 – View of explosion damage and temporary shoring</strong>

A team of Civil/Structural engineers and Engineering Technologists quickly developed an emergency response strategy, which involved an initial structural assessment, 3D scanning of the damaged structure to establish a baseline condition for continuous monitoring, design and installation of temporary shoring to support the damaged building, and the use of a 90 ton mobile crane to temporarily support the top portion of the building while workers accessed the severely damaged area (Photograph 2).

An ‘Emergency Response Proposal’ was developed, which included a scope of work detailing the design of the emergency shoring and support system as well as installation and safety procedures to be adhered to throughout the emergency response. The plan evolved as required throughout the process and was implemented in cooperation with the Restoration Contractor, with members of the emergency response team present throughout the installation to monitor progress and provide assistance when necessary.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-2244" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Pablo1.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="368" />       <img class="alignnone  wp-image-2245" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Pablo2.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="364" />

<strong>Photograph 2 – View of 90 ton crane operation and set-up</strong>

The completed shoring system rendered the building temporarily safe for thorough inspection by the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal, which was investigating the explosion. At the same time, Fire and Electrical experts were permitted to complete an investigation of the explosion and were able to provide conclusions regarding origin and cause.

During the development and implementation of the emergency response, additional assessments of various environmental and cleaning requirements were also identified and undertaken within the damaged building. The explosion had caused significant particulate accumulation as well as some minor smoke and soot damage. An Environmental Health and Safety team was able to provide a cleaning plan to remediate the identified environmental factors. In addition, an Electrical Investigations team became involved in the case when asked to assess damage to the building’s electrical room and power distribution system and provide recommendations for remediation. At this point, a diverse team of experts was onsite and working together to support the successful remediation of the damaged building.

Following completion of the origin and cause investigations, the emergency response team was asked to return to the site to thoroughly investigate the explosion‑related damage and provide recommendations for restoring the building to its pre‑loss condition. Following the investigation, a detailed assessment of the explosion-related damage, accompanied by a detailed scope of work and drawings to facilitate the remediation process was competed and the building permit to allow remediation efforts to commence was secured.

Damaged structural elements of the building were selectively removed and replaced, restoring the structural integrity of the building, and new siding, roofing and additional finishes were installed. The cleaning measures proposed by the environmental team were implemented and the building’s electrical system was repaired.

Following completion of the remediation work, the affected structure had been reinstated to its pre-loss condition, and the owner of the building was able to resume operations with the confidence that the structure was safe for its intended occupants and uses. Ultimately, it was the quick initial response and the innovative solutions for temporary shoring that prevented the necessity of a full demolition, and allowed for the completion of the origin and cause investigations and repair of the damaged structure. Repairing the damage to the building was done at a fraction of the cost of rebuilding, as construction of a new building would have required the removal and replacement of the entire structure, including all the mechanical and electrical equipment, and would have involved a significantly greater business interruption. Through saving the damaged structure and eliminating the necessity for a costly demolition and rebuilding process, this case was closed knowing that the building was safe and the most practical and cost‑effective solutions was implemented.

Success on a case such as this can be attributed to a tightly-coordinated effort utilizing specialists across a number of disciplines. No one expert could have achieved this success alone. This case exemplifies the power of deploying a multidisciplinary team in the face of a complex loss scenario, and fuels the curiosity to discover what greater innovations and successes are possible when experts combine forces.

		<title><![CDATA[Silo Failures Caused by Unrealistic Design Considerations]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Many silo failures have occurred as a result of unrealistic loading conditions assumed during the design phase. Other failures have been attributed to changes in the use of silo structures without proper consideration of the implications. In some cases, more stringent loading conditions were introduced with changes to the stored material properties or the implementation of different discharge mechanisms. The limited existing design guidelines have contributed to oversimplified designs, as they fail to consider complex loading conditions, such as those caused by the asymmetric flow of stored materials.

Silo failures can cause loss of life and significant damage to adjacent structures and equipment when they occur at industrial plants or storage facilities (Figure 1). Silo structures tend to lack redundancy, and their failures can be catastrophic. Contributing factors may include poor design considerations, construction deficiencies, change of use, deterioration and lack of maintenance, and others (Figure 2). The cost of remediation after a catastrophic failure can be significant as it may include forensic investigations, temporary emergency response measures, shoring, demolition of the damaged structures, repair designs, and reconstruction.

During remediation of a catastrophic silo collapse, the permanent repairs may require the reconstruction of a silo as well as the repair or reconstruction of adjacent damaged structures. The repair or replacement of damaged mechanical equipment, electrical instrumentations and control systems, and other components may significantly increase the remediation cost. An insurance claim may also need to cover significant expenses or losses related to the business interruption of an industrial plant or storage facility that may need to remain closed for a significant period after a catastrophic failure of a silo structure. In some cases, litigation may occur after a silo failure, causing a possible surge in the cost of remediation as well as significant delays. In some cases, the litigation occurs after remediation of the structures to curtailed rising business interruption cost.

<em> Figure 2. Chart of possible consequences resulting from a silo failure</em>

The design, construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of silos requires the involvement of many stakeholders. The obvious stakeholders include the owner, the design engineers, the construction and maintenance contractors, and the operational managers and personnel. Other stakeholders include the insurance companies that provide coverage in the event of damage or failure, the banks or financial institutions that finance the construction or maintenance of projects related to the use of silos at industrial or storage facilities, the owners of neighbouring properties that could be affected by silo failures, and others.

To prevent silo failures, regardless of the age of the structure, the property owner and stakeholders should assess the condition of silo structures and monitor any changes on a scheduled basis (e.g. semi-annually or annually). Qualified personnel should verify if the original design considerations are consistent with current loading conditions, and ensure that the silo structures are capable of supporting the current loading conditions including the possible asymmetric flow of materials. The loading conditions related to the specific industry can be complex, and failures can occur due to failure to perform the proper analysis and testing that goes beyond the limited recommendations provided in the available industry standards and guidelines. A preventive engineering assessment can significantly reduce the risk of failure and avoid the corresponding remediation cost (Figure 3).

<em>Figure 3. Possible Stakeholders involved in preventing a silo failure on a regular basis</em>

Silo structures are used in many industries as an essential component of process plants and storage facilities. For instance, silos are commonly used to store bulk raw and processed materials. The following list includes a few examples among many other applications:

-Grains and other food-related products in the agricultural and food industries;

-Cement, clinker and other materials related to the cement manufacturing industry;

-Materials used for energy generation, such as coal and woodchips; and carbon black used in the production of rubber and other processed materials.

Although storage structures have been used for many centuries, the first modern upright silo was built in 1873 by Fred Hatch in Illinois, USA, for the storage of grain for the agricultural industry. Since that time, use of the upright silo for storage has spread across many industries.

Initially, most silo structures were relatively small and simple regarding the design, materials, and loading conditions. Over time, the need to increase production and store greater amounts of bulk materials has pushed the innovation and design limits to build bigger silos with more complex configurations, loading conditions, and material handling technologies. However, the research and development of codes and standards governing the design of silo structures have not advanced at the same pace, leaving a gap between the challenges imposed by more advanced technologies and the limited existing design guidelines and regulations. Thus, silo failures have occurred because of unrealistic design considerations.

Through most of the 20th century, the traditional design of silo structures assumed a concentric flow of the stored material through discharge mechanisms which, in many cases, included concentric hoppers. Therefore, the structural design was performed by estimating concentric material pressures at specific heights. The assumed lateral pressures were to be resisted by the cylindrical silo walls, mainly through uniform hoop tension. The vertical traction loads were to be resisted through uniform compression of the silo wall in the vertical direction. Since the flow of material was considered concentric, the material pressures were assumed to be uniform along the perimeter of the silo wall cross‑section at any given height. The assumption was that the silo would be subjected mainly to axial stresses. While this is true of small silos with concentric flow of material, increasingly larger and more slender silos were constructed, which necessitated an asymmetric flow of material.

With the increase of storage capacity and industrial applications, more modern and sophisticated discharge technologies utilized in large silos required eccentric discharge outlets, further generating asymmetric flow and eccentric pressures (Figure 4). Problematically, in some jurisdictions, the code provisions allowed for overly simplified designs which failed to take into account the critical loading conditions caused by asymmetric flow. The lack of detailed provisions to account for the effects of eccentric material flow was evident in North America and other parts of the world where the applicable standards, such as the editions of ACI 313 before 2016 (e.g., ACI 313-97<a href="https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=31397&amp;Format=DOWNLOAD&amp;Language=English" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">[2]</a>, and previous editions) did not provide proper guidance. For instance, ACI 313-97, <em>“Standard Practice for Design and Construction of Concrete Silos and Stacking Tubes for Storing Granular Materials,”</em> provided little guidance to the design engineer to properly estimate eccentric loads.
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHge15kZxhknA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1539820800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=RmRWIPuRmuqpH36Z_4Jhqe0UPfCA4m_JQoU3i2re40Q" data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5612AQHge15kZxhknA" data-li-src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHge15kZxhknA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1539820800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=RmRWIPuRmuqpH36Z_4Jhqe0UPfCA4m_JQoU3i2re40Q" /></div>

Only in the last few decades, more advanced material handling testing and modelling engineering tools, such as the relatively recent development of linear and non-linear finite element analysis software, have allowed for further research and development of more realistic models of silo structures. In the last couple of decades, some standards have already incorporated design provisions to account for more realistic loading conditions, such as those concerning the design of silos that would likely exhibit an eccentric flow of the stored material. Asymmetric flow results from the formation of flow channels inside slender silos or in silos that incorporate eccentric discharge mechanisms, such as eccentric discharge outlets and inverted discharge cones.

For instance, the European standard for the design of silo and tank structures, EN 1991-4:2006<a href="https://www.en-standard.eu/csn-en-1991-4-eurocode-1-actions-on-structures-part-4-silos-and-tanks/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzrnK1oHi2AIVhbfACh0erAb1EAMYASAAEgKcEPD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">[3]</a>, became one of the first and most comprehensive codes, providing detailed guidelines for design engineers to estimate most loading conditions including eccentric pressures (Figure 5). In North America, the latest version of ACI 313, published in 2016<a href="https://www.concrete.org/Portals/0/Files/PDF/Previews/313-16_preview.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">[4]</a>, acknowledges the need to consider the effects of asymmetric flow in silos and provides the corresponding guidelines.
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQGBltLE9-HQNg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1539820800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=3wn4dsdKCYEcQvDSCNw2_PzzyDoUA5AcKggtSQLO9aw" data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5612AQGBltLE9-HQNg" data-li-src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQGBltLE9-HQNg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1539820800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=3wn4dsdKCYEcQvDSCNw2_PzzyDoUA5AcKggtSQLO9aw" /></div>
<em>Figure 5. View of estimated eccentric horizontal pressures for a silo structure in accordance with EN1991-4:2006</em>

The pressures resulting from an eccentric material flow pattern would adversely change the loading conditions imposed on a silo originally designed and constructed to operate under concentric pressures. An asymmetric flow would impose axial stresses combined with flexural and shear stresses (Figure 6), instead of only axial stresses such as the case of concentric flow. For instance, a silo wall would exhibit hoop tensile plus flexural and shear stresses in the horizontal direction, and compressive plus flexural and shear stresses in the vertical direction. The combined stresses could increase the demand versus capacity ratio of critical structural elements beyond a serviceability limit state and result in partial damage or collapse of a silo structure.

<em>Figure 6. View of a finite element model showing the typical uneven distribution of stresses and deformation as a result of asymmetric flow of the stored material in a silo structure</em>

When an eccentric flow channel is formed within the stored material, and its cross-section strikes the silos wall (Figure 7), the horizontal pressure distribution along the perimeter wall cross-section will vary because of an arch effect of the material around the flow channel. The uneven distribution of pressures will then impose flexural and shear demands to the silo walls, in addition to the axial stresses (e.g., hoop tensile stresses, Figure 6).
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQFn_IbKp5ZhLQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1539820800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=euUpzfohA7NvRuqCOXgvV6paqdnt9eC7f5SKcCzhcAA" data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C5612AQFn_IbKp5ZhLQ" data-li-src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQFn_IbKp5ZhLQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1539820800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=euUpzfohA7NvRuqCOXgvV6paqdnt9eC7f5SKcCzhcAA" /></div>
<em>Figure 7. Schematic plan view of a flow channel resulting from asymmetric flow inside a silo cross-section.</em>

Bulk materials and silo wall surfaces have unique material properties and behave differently under different material handling scenarios (e.g., at rest, during material discharge, etc.). The storage of advanced materials for new applications, the introduction of new material handling technologies, and the use of new design configurations and silo construction materials have also increased the loading complexities.

For instance, fluidized loading conditions (e.g., quasi-hydrostatic pressures) may develop when gases are added to change the temperature of the stored materials or to prevent or trigger chemical reactions. In some industries, such as cement processing and storage, the loading conditions would also change because of complex discharge mechanisms used to fluidize the material. For example, cement silo aeration systems, silo fluidizing pads, and inverted discharge cones are used to keep the material flowable at the base of cement silos. Fluidizing the material changes the loading conditions, and may cause impact loads as a result of arching and collapsing of the material above and around the fluidized material or flow channels (e.g., “rat hole formation”). Other industries may incorporate different equipment, such as pneumatic vibrators to improve the discharge process. The additional loading conditions including the effects of vibration, impact, and uneven distribution of pressures must be considered in the design of silo structures and their foundations.

In complex scenarios, the available code provisions do not cover all the realistic loading conditions, and further testing and analysis might be required. In addition to the safety risk, a silo failure can cause significant damage to adjacent structures and equipment in a process plant or a storage facility. Preventive engineering assessments and monitoring of silo conditions can greatly reduce the risk of failure and avoid onerous remediation expenses.

The remediation cost for a property owner or insurance company can be significant as it may include the initial remediation and emergency response, business interruption, structural repairs, equipment and material losses, as well as other costs. Therefore, it is important to prevent silo failures by verifying that the original design considers all the realistic loading conditions for the current use of the structure. It is also essential for design engineers to consider all the loading conditions related to the specific industry, stored material and silo wall properties, silo configuration, and discharge systems.

		<title><![CDATA[Are High Heels High Risk?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[High heels are a fashion staple that wearers often have a love/hate relationship with. Chances are you’ve worn them, know someone who wears them, or have at least seen someone walking (successfully or otherwise) down the street in them. Although high heels may be fashionable, wearing them for prolonged periods of time can lead to injury. While the common issues associated with high heel use relate to foot pain, high heels can also increase the risk of injury due to slips and falls.

There is ample research demonstrating that footwear sole properties, such as tread pattern, tread material, and wear, impact the risk of slipping and falling. However, high heels have additional notable properties that differentiate them from ‘typical’ footwear like running shoes. As the name would suggest, high heels have a higher heel than typical footwear and are also generally smaller in area and have less surface in contact with the walking surface.  Research has demonstrated that there is an increased risk of slipping while walking in high heels [1]. A recent study examining high heels with heels of varying contact areas (Figure 1) showed that there was an increased risk of slipping while walking in footwear with smaller (narrower) heels [2].

<img class="size-full wp-image-2579 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/HeelsArticle.png" alt="" width="624" height="312" />

<strong>Figure 1: Various high heel areas tested.</strong>

High heels have been associated with an increased fall risk for older adults [3]. High heels put wearers at greater risk of falling due to their impact on stability and balance. Studies with younger and older women that compared high heels to flat shoes or barefoot conditions have shown that the high heels were associated with worse outcomes in standing balance tests and greater instability during walking [4,5,6].

Overall, high heels put wearers at a greater risk of slipping and falling than flat-soled footwear such as running shoes. However, considering some of the additional footwear factors impacting falls, precautions such as ensuring that the high heels fit properly, opting for shoes with a larger heel contact area, and choosing footwear with a tread pattern when possible, may help mitigate some of the increased risks of high heels.

		<content><![CDATA[In a society where almost half the population uses ride-hailing services such as taxis, Uber, and Lyft, it’s shocking to consider passenger use of seatbelts, or lack thereof.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> People tend to be pretty good at buckling up when they’re in the front seat of a passenger vehicle. However, statistics show that people are less likely to use their seatbelts when seated in the rear.

Recent research has shown that only 72% of passengers reported always wearing their seatbelt in the rear seat when in a personal vehicle, indicating that more than one-quarter of the population sometimes – or never – does.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Seatbelt use decreases when passengers use a ride-hailing service, where only 57% of passengers reported always using their seatbelts while in the rear-seat.

Of the passengers that reported not using seatbelts in the rear-seat in general, over 25% said they believed the rear seat was safer than the front and they didn’t feel the need to wear a seatbelt.  The decrease in seatbelt usage when in a hired vehicle was associated with travelling short distances or at low speeds, both of which made passengers feel wearing a seatbelt was unnecessary.

However, not wearing your seatbelt in a vehicle, whether personal or hired, increases the risk of injury for yourself and the other occupants – especially those who are belted and seated in front of an unrestrained passenger.

When a vehicle is accelerated as the result of a collision, the rear-seat passengers tend to continue moving in their original direction of travel until they contact a component of the vehicle interior, such as the seatbelt, seatback, or centre console. The extent of a passenger’s motion is influenced by the severity of the collision, direction of the collision forces, restraint use, and intrusion of vehicle structures into the occupant compartment space. In a frontal collision, passengers will move forward relative to the vehicle interior.

In an unrestrained scenario, this motion results in rear-seated passengers moving forward into the driver’s seatback and potentially into the front of the vehicle, at their initial travel speed, until they are slowed by interior contacts. A recent crash test conducted by the <a href="https://www.iihs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a> (IIHS) provides insight into the motion of an unrestrained rear-seat passenger during a simulated frontal collision with a severity of approximately 56 km/h.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><sup>,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></sup> During the initial stages of the collision, an unrestrained passenger will continue forward and upward into the driver’s seatback and headrest. The passenger’s knees may contact the seatback in the early stage of the collision and the passenger may continue forward and upward, striking their head and chest on the driver’s seatback and headrest.

<em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Time-lapsed imaged obtained from the onboard camera in the vehicle during the initial stages of the <a href="https://www.iihs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IIHS</a> test conducted with an unbelted rear-seat passenger.</em>

The unrestrained rear-seat passenger acts as a projectile or ‘bullet’ within the vehicle. Their forward motion into the seatback in front of them can cause forward deformation of the seat, increasing the injury potential for the occupants seated in front.

The odds of death for a belted driver seated directly in front of an unrestrained passenger in a serious head-on collision increase by more than two times when compared to similar crashes where they were seated in front of a restrained passenger. <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Similarly, the driver’s risk of severe injury was eight times greater with an unbelted rear passenger than with a belted passenger. The driver’s risk of severe injury was highest when their seat was deformed forward, which increased when there was an unbelted rear passenger.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

A recent decision in <em>Stewart v. the Corporation of the Township of Douro-Dummer</em>, addressed liability in a collision where occupants were unrestrained in a hired vehicle. The incident involved four passengers who had been out drinking and decided to go home by taking a taxi. On the drive home, the taxi was involved in a collision. One of the passengers injured in the collision was not wearing their seatbelt. The issue contested in this case was whether there was liability on the driver for the passenger’s failure to wear a seatbelt.

The ruling, which came out June 26, 2018, stated that there was “<em>no duty of the taxi cab driver to ensure that passengers are or remain buckled.</em>” Additionally, the judge ruled that “<em>even if there had been a duty of care on</em> [the cab driver]<em>, the duty would have required</em> [the driver] <em>to advise</em> [the passenger] <em>to buckle his seat belt after he entered the taxi cab.  In this case,</em> [the passenger] <em>was buckled when he got into the taxi cab. As such, </em>[the driver] <em>would not have breached any standard of care or caused any injury to</em> [the passenger] <em>from his failure to ensure</em> [the passenger] <em>was buckled at the commencement of the trip.</em>”

Regardless of how you are getting around the city, by personal passenger vehicles or ride-hailing services, think twice before riding in the rear-seat without your seatbelt. Unrestrained occupants put themselves, and those in the vehicle with them, at risk.

<a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Collision severity is quantified by the change in velocity, or ‘delta-v’, which is the difference between the pre-impact and post-impact velocity of a vehicle. For example, if a vehicle is stopped and struck from behind such that it is accelerated forward to a speed of 10 km/h, the collision severity would be 10 km/h. In the IIHS test, the vehicle was accelerated rearward up to a speed of 56 km/h to simulate a frontal collision. The delta-v is widely regarded as a good indicator of impact severity in collision reconstruction.

		<title><![CDATA[Marijuana legalization, claims of impairment and driver behaviour - Has the typical approach to assessing risk and liability gone up in smoke?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Nothing else stirs up a debate quite like the topic of marijuana legalization. What was once a discussion premised on fiction, has now entered the realm of reality. The Province of Ontario has acted on federal mandates to legalize and regulate recreational use of cannabis, as well as to outline how it will be sold and distributed.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> While other provinces work towards similar ends, there are those that believe legalization will create an uptick in consumption as it will become more easily accessible to more people. What this means for safety on our roadways and the investigations of collisions involving allegations of impairment is top of mind for many in the auto insurance and legal industries.

<img class="size-full wp-image-2619 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/weed.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="340" />
<h4><strong>Black and white, with shades of grey</strong></h4>
For those with a stake in reducing collision rates, there is reason to be nervous. A roadway congested with drivers under the influence of marijuana is probably not a safe one. It is generally understood that cannabis consumption impairs psychomotor abilities (such as attention, decision-making, visual scanning, and perception) required for safe driving.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Logically, such ‘impairment’ should then increase the risk of collisions. However, the scientific community is far from a consensus on the effect of marijuana consumption on driver performance and how it may increase collision risk. For as many studies that report a link between consumption and an increase in collision risk, others find that collision risk does not change with consumption of cannaboids, or that it may even decrease.<sup>2</sup> The latter situation is observed in individuals whom after reportedly consuming marijuana overestimate their level of impairment and make compensatory adjustments to their driving behaviour (such as reducing speed and keeping a greater distance between vehicles)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> which helps to counterbalance marijuana’s detrimental effects on other aspects of driver performance.
<h4><strong>Who or what is at fault?</strong></h4>
Collisions are highly rare events when considered against the backdrop of the sheer volume of drivers and cars on the roadway, and yet the ‘one-in-a-million’ events occur many times per day. When collisions occur, the list of potential causes or contributing elements includes human-, environmental-, roadway- and vehicle-related factors. However, it is generally understood that the ‘human factor’ represents the lion’s share of cause in any collision event. Indirect evidence broadly suggests that human error and behavioural aspects of the driver (such as speed and navigational control) collectively contributes the vast majority of collisions.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Impairment affects this slice of the causation pie.

The investigation of driver behaviour in a particular collision event can help shed light on the precise human contribution to the cause of the collision. Characterizing the pre-impact behaviour of a driver is accomplished by comparing it against what objective science would support as being normal or abnormal.  Fortunately, research of driver behaviour has been conducted over many decades, in which drivers have been placed in both typical and atypical roadway situations. While simultaneously monitoring the environment and driver behaviour in highly controlled laboratory or naturalistic studies in the real-world, this research has provided a clear picture of what to expect of drivers in various situations, ranging from the most mundane (like stopping for a stop sign) to the most severe (like responding to a high speed head-on collision threat).

The behaviours of drivers are characterized in various ways, but the typical battery includes, for example: hazard detection (did they consider the intruding vehicle as a hazard when they should have?), perception and reaction time (did they respond in a typical amount of time following detection of the hazard?), braking/steering responses (did they select the response expected of drivers in a similar situation?), visibility distance (was there sufficient lighting in the area to observe the hazard before impact?). Whether a driver performed as expected in some or all of these aspects or whether a departure from normal contributed to the collision can be known through direct study of pre-impact driver behaviour.

In the context of alleged impairment, why does research of normal driver behaviour matter? Simply put, it forms the baseline against which we compare the behaviour of a driver involved in a collision. It sets the bar for what to expect from attentive drivers in a similar situation, and allows an investigator to determine if an incident driver’s behaviour fell short of the mark. In other words, if driver performance is compromised because of intoxication or impairment, it should be revealed in a test against ‘normal’ behaviour expected of drivers in a similar situation.
<h4><strong>Piecing it back together</strong></h4>
To make more sense of this approach, consider the hypothetical analysis of a collision in which an allegedly impaired driver did not brake at all prior to the collision. If following a study of typical (sober) drivers it was determined that the incident driver was expected to have avoided the collision by braking 3-seconds prior to impact, then a departure from such behaviour is a contributing factor to the collision occurrence. In such cases, factors that contribute to delayed response, such as impairment through some substance, are among those relevant to an assessment of what caused the collision.

Now consider that the driver instead behaved as expected of a typical motorist, despite the allegation of impairment. What if it is determined that the driver had ingested marijuana immediately prior to the collision yet their behaviour was characteristically sober? In the example above, if a driver responded 3-seconds before impact despite having consumed marijuana, the contribution of cannabis (or any other substance for that matter) is less obvious to the extent that it may be irrelevant toward understanding why a collision occurred in the first place. Given the spectrum of reported effects of marijuana consumption on driver behaviour, this outcome may not be unexpected. The implication of this situation is that an analysis of driver behaviour may refute an allegation of impairment, or the contribution of alleged impairment to the collision itself.

Whether impairment caused or contributed to a collision is critical in the assessment of liability in tort law, and the presence or gravity of charges laid in criminal actions. Changes to the status quo of marijuana legalization may bring to the forefront questions previously unanswered, especially in the early days when new rules and regulations have not yet been tested through the rigours of time and precedence. To reduce the uncertainty over the short and long term, it would be wise to directly address claims of impaired driving with pointed assessments of driver behaviour. With that information in hand, claims involving impaired drivers can be handled with more confidence even in uncertain times.

		<title><![CDATA[Do winter tires prevent collisions? Is it as simple as advertised?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[This week reminded us in southern Ontario that winter driving season is upon us! With it, winter tire publicity is ramping up. Advertisers are out promoting the benefits of winter tires, and media coverage and police reports often leave us with the perception that a lack of winter tire use was the cause of the latest multi-vehicle pileup.

With so much information available it can be difficult to distinguish the root cause of a collision from things that may just be contributing factors or worse yet, simply unrelated matters of circumstance. The problem when it comes to winter tires generally stems from a lack of understanding of what makes them different from all-season tires and what those differences mean in terms of vehicle performance.

<img class=" wp-image-2678 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Wintertire3-300x151.png" alt="" width="548" height="276" />

The objective of winter tire designers is straight-forward: design a tire that can readily move loose snow and ice out of the way so that the tire can make contact with the hard-packed surface below and subsequently adhere to that surface even if its ice-covered and very cold. Consequently, there are two primary differences between winter tires and their all-season cousins, those being the tread patterns used and the materials from which they are constructed. For obvious reasons, winter tire designs often include an intricate network of large channels to assist with the bulk movement of snow and ice from beneath the tire. What is often overlooked is that they also include much finer details such as greater use of ‘sipes’ (thin slits cut into the rubber) or additives to significantly increase traction in icy conditions. As for the differences in materials, the compounds used in winter tires are generally ‘softer’ at the same temperatures than those used in all-season tires and are formulated to better adhere to ice and snow.

In general, the ‘softness’ of any tire decreases as the temperature drops. In terms of vehicle performance, there is a trade-off with tire ‘softness’: if a tire is too soft it will not be able to generate the loads required for good handling and braking performance and will wear prematurely, and if a tire is too hard then traction suffers. Accordingly, there is an optimal level of ‘softness’ for any given temperature. At low temperatures, the softer winter tires provide better performance than all-season tires, and at high temperatures the situation is reversed. The transition temperature at which most winter tires begin outperforming most all-season tires on dry asphalt is generally accepted to be around 7 degrees Celsius, however this may not always be the case depending on the specific construction of the tire. The difference in performance increases sharply at sub-zero temperatures and in snowy or icy conditions.

When temperatures get well below zero and there is snow on the roadway, winter tires in good condition will significantly outperform their all-season counterparts. When temperatures are above zero and the roads are clear, the differences in performance between the tires is marginal, and when temperatures creep into the teens during a thaw period, a vehicle may actually perform better if equipped with all-season tires regardless of what the calendar says. The caveat to all of this is of course is that these comparisons assume adequate tread depth and inflation pressure. Those often overlooked factors can be critical in assessing tire performance. If a winter tire is not inflated properly and/or is significantly worn, it may well perform worse in snowy conditions than an all-season tire in better condition.

To determine whether or not any improvements in tire performance would make the difference between colliding with or avoiding another vehicle in a particular instance, an assessment of how much traction is being demanded of the tires during a particular vehicle manoeuvre must be made. Driving on tires that perform worse than others in the same conditions is not ideal, but it may be more than enough to be safe under the circumstances. The difference in performance only become an issue when a driver demands something of the tire that it is incapable of providing at a given moment. This is a key point that must be considered in any assessment of causation.

In addition to all of these issues, the variety of configurations in which winter tires are mounted on vehicles can have a significant effect. In practice it is not uncommon to see vehicles equipped with a mix of all-season and winter tires. Conventional wisdom generally results in a configuration in which two winter tires are mounted on the drive axle while all-season tires are left on the undriven axle. The oft-cited reason for this setup being the need for good traction on the drive axle in order accelerate out of deep snow. Such reasoning is erroneous, however, as there is much more to vehicle performance than acceleration. Vehicle stability, particularly during heavy steering or braking in slippery conditions, is arguably more important from a safety standpoint and it is significantly compromised when the four tires of a vehicle do not have the same performance capabilities.

While the ‘snow tires on the drive wheels only’ configuration was never optimal for vehicle performance, it was less dangerous in the days of rear-wheel drive vehicles. With the domination of front-wheel drive vehicles in the marketplace, this conventional wisdom can have catastrophic results. In my work as a collision reconstructionist I have seen many examples of vehicles that have lost control in winter conditions causing them to veer into oncoming traffic or off the road in part because they were equipped with winter tires on only the front axle. The reason for this is because vehicles are less stable under braking and steering when the tires with the most traction are located on the front axle, than when the situation is reversed.

Tire manufacturers correctly point out that the maximum benefit derived from the use of winter tires occurs when they are placed on all four wheels of a vehicle. This is not just a sales ploy, it is in fact optimal for stability and performance reasons. Testing has shown that vehicles equipped with four winter tires in winter conditions will stop shorter and under greater control than vehicles equipped with various configurations of winter tires mixed with all-season tires.

All of the foregoing is true regardless of what type of technology the vehicle in question may be equipped with. Anti-lock brake, traction control, stability control, and all-wheel drive systems are great assets to have in winter driving conditions, however these systems merely take advantage of the tractive capabilities of a given tire, rather than changing what those capabilities are. They too are entirely dependent on good tire performance in order to be of any assistance.

In summary, establishing whether or not the use of a specific type of tire had any effect on a given collision is highly dependent on the specifics of the weather conditions at the time, the condition and type of the tires involved, and where on the vehicle they were installed. Further, all of these factors must be assessed within the context of the driving manoeuvres attempted and the vehicle speeds involved in order to identify whether tire type or use was a contributory cause.

So, to answer the title of this post: Sometimes, and no.

		<title><![CDATA[Tackling Concussions – Football’s Newest Helmet Technology]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[With the Superbowl just around the corner, we thought we would provide an update on the new helmet technology you may have noticed throughout the 2018 season and the steps the NFL has taken to address the steady number of concussions sustained by NFL players.

Over the past 7 years, the NFL has seen a steady rate of concussions during the football season.  The 2016 NFL injury data indicated that an average of 220 concussions are reported each season (159 was the lowest reported number of concussions in 2010; the highest was 275 in 2015).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) reported that concussions make up 7.4% of all injuries in college football players.

<img class=" wp-image-2810 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/NFL-Concussions.png" alt="" width="400" height="370" />

Concussions occur when the head is exposed to a high-energy impact resulting in large head accelerations. Pellman et al.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> found that the average linear acceleration associated with concussion was 98 g, while Rowson and Duma,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> who collected data from both professional and collegiate football players, found the average was 105 g. To put this into perspective, activities of daily living such as plopping into a chair or hopping off a step may result in head accelerations of 8.5 and 6.7 g, respectively, while linear head accelerations associated with heading a soccer ball can range from 11.9 to 28.1 g in girls’ youth soccer.

The typical football helmet is designed to prevent skull fractures and consists of a hard plastic shell with thick padding on the inside. The overall design of football helmets has not changed significantly since the 1970s when Riddell first introduced energy-absorbing technology to ‘soften impacts.’<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> However, in 2014, Riddell introduced smart technology called ‘InSite’ into their helmets. InSite sends alerts to coaches when a single significant head impact occurs or when multiple head impacts occur that, when combined, may pose a risk to the player. However, this technology only shows an indication that a threshold for injury has been exceeded and does not show coaches the actual head acceleration sustained by the player.

Riddell and Xenith used to be the only two authorized suppliers of helmets to the NFL. In 2017, CBS Sports reported that the Zero1 helmet, by VICIS, was used by 25 NFL teams in the 2017 season. This season, 28 out of the 32 NFL teams are sporting the new helmet by VICIS, meaning that more than half of the players in the NFL were using this helmet.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>

The Zero1 helmet uses concepts similar to that of vehicle bumpers and is the first helmet designed to mitigate concussion risk; however, VICIS is careful to warn that “<em>no helmet can prevent concussions</em>” and “<em>a correlation between impact reduction and a reduction in concussion risk has not been established</em>” with their new helmet design.

This new technology aims to dissipate energy equally throughout the helmet during both linear and rotational accelerations. The new design allows the helmet to elastically deform at impact (i.e., deform and return to its initial shape) and uses individual columns (‘pillars’) instead of a thick layer of padding, which allows bending and deformation under loads to help share and dissipate the energy from head impacts.

All helmets must meet the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) to pass impact limits for linear acceleration. Supplementary to this is the Virginia Tech Helmet Rating which ranks helmets based on which ones best reduce concussion risk. The 5 star system indicates which helmets decrease head accelerations best.

The VICIS, Riddell, and Xenith helmets all meet the NOCSAE requirements, and the 2017 NFL/NFPLA Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results Poster ranked all three helmets in the top ratings for helmet selection in the NFL.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> Both Riddell and Xenith have received 5 stars in the Virginia Tech Helmet Rating for several of their helmets, and just this year,  the VICIS Zero 1 received 5 stars and ranked second overall in all helmets tested by Virginia Tech.

While no helmet can completely eliminate the risk of a concussion, we are interested to see how the rate of concussion reporting will be influenced by this new technology and whether it will be an integral part in the next step towards prevention and mitigation of head injuries in youth sports as the technology trickles down to the general public. The current cost of the VICIS helmet is at a steep $1,500, which limits its attractiveness to college and youth players.

Another twist in the NFL this year was the new head contact ruling: “<em>It is a foul if a player lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent.</em>" A combination of improved technology and rule implementation may just be the key to start seeing a reduction in concussion reporting in the NFL. Hopefully, the steps being made in this sport will trickle throughout the sporting industry and youth sports.

		<title><![CDATA[Uncertainties in Structural Designs & their Associated Risks]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Contrary to popular belief, it is a myth that structural engineering designs always deal with quantities that are perfectly known. There are numerous sources of inherent uncertainties in each design step that are not easily quantifiable.

Uncertainties in estimating loads: Load components, such as the weight of the structure, use and occupancy, or loads from environmental origins, namely, wind, snow or earthquakes, vary to a different degree. Figure 1 below displays one possible loading history which continuously varies and cannot be considered as a known quantity. The sources of variabilities depend on the load source. For example, uncertainties in wind loads originate from:
<ol>
 	<li>The continuous variation in wind speed;</li>
 	<li>Varied confidence in mathematical and wind tunnel models relating wind speed to pressure (force) on a structure; and</li>
 	<li>The variation in building shapes and locations.</li>
</ol>
<a href="https://www.30fe.com/service/civilstructural-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4057 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/MohamedArticlePic1-300x164.png" alt="" width="300" height="164" /></a>Uncertainties in analysis methods are mainly related to:
<ol>
 	<li>How well a mathematical, physical, or a computer model can represent the actual structural behavior;</li>
 	<li>How accurate the idealized loads, such as the ones defined in building codes, represents the actual load effects; and</li>
 	<li>How precise the prediction of the strength of a member/connection is e.g. using methods such as those in material design standards.</li>
</ol>
Uncertainties in material properties &amp; element dimensions: No two similar pieces of structural material are exactly alike in strength. Variability in material properties depends on factors such as:
<ol>
 	<li>Type of material and its source;</li>
 	<li>Chemical composition; and</li>
 	<li>Quality control on production and construction, etc.</li>
</ol>
Natural construction material such as sawn timber (wood) experience higher variability compared to materials that are a product of a controlled manufacturing process (such as steel). Similarly, to a lesser degree, no two similar structural members are exactly alike in dimension. This results from the fabrication and construction process. A reasonable tolerance is accepted by the industry where the margin of error is feasibly or economically unavoidable.

Uncertainties in construction quality &amp; use: Are due to human factors originating from the departure of good construction practices, errors and omissions, lack of knowledge, workmanship, communication problems, inadequate maintenance, and misuse.

<a href="https://www.30fe.com/service/building-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-4058 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/MohamedArticlePic2-300x142.png" alt="" width="701" height="332" /></a>

<strong>Figure </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>: Changes in loading on a typical building throughout its service life</strong>

These uncertainties effectively mean that actual loads and structural resistance may end up being either higher or lower than expected by design. Both are possible depending on the situation.

For example, a situation may arise where the actual loads are lower than expected and the actual strength is higher than expected.  This is a favorable situation (i.e., safer). However, unfavorable situations can occur when structures with lower than expected resistance happen to experience higher than expected loads. This failure probability is managed and reduced via design and quality control measures.

Notwithstanding the underlying uncertainties, the structural design must protect the public from injury and avoid financial and amenity losses caused by structural failure or instability.

While the value design parameters and properties may not be a perfectly known quantity, data is available to aid a plausible design such as the most probable value (mean value) and the expected range and distribution.

Fortunately, designers do not need to consider the variability in loads and resistance in every design. Depending on the engineer’s expertise, some might not even know that they exist. These variabilities are addressed in building codes and design standards at the backend and are hidden from the users.

Variability in loading is addressed by assigning load factors greater than unity to each load component. A higher load factor is assigned for load components that have been determined with less certainty. Hence, dead loads are assigned to the lowest load factor compared to loads from use and occupancy, or from environmental loads. On the other hand, resistance factors, that are less than unity, are applied to reduce the calculated nominal member/connection strength. A lower resistance factor is assigned to strength components that are determined with less certainty. The resistance factor associated with the design of steel members is higher than those associated with concrete or wood members.

While compliance with <a href="https://www.30fe.com/service/building-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">codes and standards</a> increases building safety, there is still margin for failure. Absolute safety (i.e., zero probability of failure) cannot be practically achieved. Because of the uncertainties in loads, engineering properties, and models predicting the behaviour, even a perfectly well-designed and well-constructed structure serves its function with a miniscule, finite probability of failure. The minute residual risk must be either shared, transferred, or accepted.

The Building Code of Canada recognizes that there is no absolute safety in the real world when it comes to building design. The Building Code states that “<em>An objective of this Code is to <strong>limit the probability</strong> that, as a result of its design or construction, a building or part of it will be exposed to an <strong>unacceptable risk</strong> of damage or loss of use due to structural failure</em>.“ The term “<em>unacceptable risk,”</em> infers that there is, indeed, an acceptable risk.

The acceptable level of risk is a subtle concept. How safe is ‘safe enough?’ This concept is mainly inferred by:
<ol>
 	<li>Societal expectations and perceptions;</li>
 	<li>Probable consequences of failures; and</li>
 	<li>Cost associated with safety measures.</li>
</ol>
Society expects that persons within or adjacent to a structure are safe. Failure of buildings and other structures must be rare. Moreover, certain classes of buildings and structures are expected to be ‘safer’ than others because any deficiency or failure would create catastrophic consequences; for instance, a nuclear facility versus a farmer’s barn. Cost is also vital. It is important to understand that there are financial costs with increased safety. The lower the cost of ‘buying’ more safety (i.e., the cheaper the cost of safety measures) the more plausible it is to implement. Codes and standards attempt to quantify the level of safety into a measurable metric and orchestrate the design requirements to achieve it while balancing reliability, economy, and practicality.

The uncertainties embedded in structural engineering designs are eloquently articulated in this definition: "s<em>tructural engineering is the art of molding materials we don't wholly understand, into shapes we cannot fully analyze, so as to withstand forces we can't really assess, in such a way that the community at large has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance</em>" - Dr.  E. H. Brown (in his 1967 book, Structural Analysis Volume 1.)

In the real world, nothing is risk-free. Structural design, as it involves human activities and natural phenomenon, are no exception.

		<title><![CDATA[Post-Fire Risks -- Notre Dame Cathedral Restorers Share The Same Concerns]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Fires can be devastating to the properties, neighborhoods and families that they affect. When we see, read or hear of reports of fires we wonder how it happened, who it impacted and hope no one was injured. But as the news reports come and go and the next fire is reported on, there is much work to be done on a fire affected property to return it to its pre-loss condition. Assessing and addressing the damages in a timely manner is key to mitigating the loss.

<strong>Fires cause damage to a structure in three ways:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Direct fire damage to the structural members and interior surfaces (e.g. charred wood, deformed steel, spalled concrete due to flame and heat of the fire)</li>
 	<li>Smoke and soot infiltration throughout the building and onto the surfaces and into the cavities of the building</li>
 	<li>Fire-fighting suppression water that damages interior finishes, promotes secondary damage in the form of mould and damage to materials through rapid temperature changes</li>
</ol>
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48022661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4063 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/FireArticlePic1-300x186.png" alt="" width="300" height="186" /></a>Obviously, the direct fire damage i.e. a burned-out roof can leave a building susceptible to exposure to the elements (i.e. snow and rain) which can exacerbate the environmental effects in the form of mould growth on building materials and surface finishes. Therefore, it is critical that temporary protection be implemented as quick as possible to try to mitigate the secondary damage, especially if the remaining structure is being salvaged. This is the situation that is currently being confronted in the fire that damaged <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48022661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notre Dame Cathedral</a> in Paris. Ideally, the fire-damaged elements can be removed, and new temporary roof platform constructed that can be protected and sealed, rather than simply putting tarps over the fire-damaged structure where it can deteriorate and be punctured. Further, temporary protective measures can buy time especially if the structural repairs are complicated, i.e. a townhouse complex truss roof with a triangular footprint or an 850-year old wooden roof structure.

<a href="https://www.30fe.com/service/multi-disciplinary-remediation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-4064 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/FireArticlePic2-300x253.png" alt="" width="380" height="321" /></a>As a fire burns, combustion by-products such as smoke, soot and other chemicals can be deposited throughout the building on exposed surfaces and in hidden areas, such as wall cavities. Smoke and soot can be distributed via the fire’s energy and temperature extremes causing pressurization differences with respect to adjacent unaffected areas and through a building’s heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVACR) system. Areas within the fire impacted building may appear unaffected by the fire because there is no obvious structural damage, but deposited combustion by-products can leave particulate, smoke odours and residual chemicals that that can be an ongoing annoyance or can lead to chemical exposures resulting in negative health effects to the building occupants and workers. Additionally, unaddressed combustion by-product impacts may cause corrosion and eventually lead to failures of electrical and other building systems within a property. A complete smoke and soot assessment can be the key to properly allocating resources and flagging items for removal and cleaning.

<a href="https://www.30fe.com/service/civilstructural-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-4065 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/FireArticlePic3-300x244.png" alt="" width="380" height="309" /></a>Fire suppression water and secondary water damage from the property being open and exposed to the elements, also has negative environmental impacts in the form of mould growth on building materials. Wet areas should be noted, and steps should be taken to dry these areas within 24 to 48 hours to help prevent mould growth. Where mould growth cannot be prevented, a thorough mould and moisture assessment will identify the extent of the mould impacted building materials, so these areas can be remediated in accordance with the applicable legislation and guidelines.

As forensic engineers, we often provide advice on difficult decisions related to the protection of a fire-impacted structure.  Our preference is generally to take a more robust approach (as shown in Photo 1) to protect the interior of a structure, rather than a simpler and lower-cost approach (as shown in Photo 2) which is intended for short-term protection.  Often trade-offs are made in the name of management of a loss that can downplay some of these longer-term future risks.  Our advice to industry practitioners is to consider the risks over the life-cycle of a loss event and the intended time and extent of the remediation phase.  It is often perfectly fine to take a simple and low-cost approach, but in cases where the interior is critical – such as at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris – or a long reconstruction period is expected, it may be wise to consider (with greater weight) the need for more robust protection of a damaged property.

		<title><![CDATA[Les passagers sont moins probables d’utiliser leurs ceintures lorsqu’ils sont assis à l’arrière d’un véhicule (“Adults admit they often skip belt in rear-seat” – IIHS News)]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Plus que la moitié de la population utilise les services de transport de covoiturage comme les taxis, Uber, Lyft, etc. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Il est donc surprenant de découvrir que les occupants n’utilisent pas toujours leurs ceintures de sécurité. Pour la plupart, quand assis à l’avant d’un véhicule, on est diligent avec l’utilisation de nos ceintures; cependant, les statistiques indiquent que les passagers sont moins probables d’utiliser leurs ceintures lorsqu’ils sont assis à l’arrière d’un véhicule.

En effet, la recherche indique que seulement 72% des passagers utilisent leurs ceintures de sécurité tout le temps quand assis à l’arrière d’un véhicule personnel (e.g., un véhicule conduit par un ami ou quelqu’un qu’ils connaissent); ce qui veut dire que plus qu’un quart de la population n’utilisent jamais leurs ceintures de sécurité ou utilisent leurs ceintures de sécurité seulement quelque fois quand ils sont assis à l’arrière. <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Ce qui est vraiment surprenant est que l’utilisation des ceintures de sécurité est réduite lorsqu’on utilisent un service de covoiturage - où seulement 57% des passagers assis à l’arrière utilisent leurs ceintures de sécurité!

Parmi les passagers qui rapportent qu’ils n’utilisent pas leurs ceintures de sécurité quand assis à l’arrière, plus que 25% dises qu’ils croient qu’ils sont plus sécures quand assis dans le siège à l’arrière comparé d’être assis à l'avant; donc ils ne voient pas de raison pour porter leurs ceintures de sécurité.  La réduction dans l’usage des ceintures de sécurité lorsqu’on utilisent des taxis est attribuée à la mentalité que les passagers n'iraient pas loin ou qu’ils se déplacent à des vitesses basses. 2 Pourtant, ce que plusieurs personnes ne réalisent pas, est que lorsqu’elles ne sont pas bouclées, le risque de blessures corporelles augmente pour tous les occupants – incluant ceux qui sont bouclés et assis en avant des passagers qui n'utilisent pas leurs ceintures de sécurité.

Quand un véhicule est impliqué dans une collision, les passagers assis à l’arrière continueront à se déplacer dans la direction initiale de l’impact jusqu’à ce qu’ils interagissent avec des structures du véhicule (comme la ceinture de sécurité, le dossier du siège en avant, ou la console). L’ampleur du mouvement du passager est influencée par la sévérité de l’impact, les directions des forces de l’impact, l’utilisation des ceintures de sécurité, et l’intrusion des structures du véhicule dans l’espace des occupants.

Dans une collision frontale, un occupant assis à l’arrière va se déplacer vers l’avant par rapport au véhicule.  Un test par le « Insurance Institute of Highway Safety » (IIHS) donne du contexte à cette notion. Le test utilise des mannequins pour essais de collision impliqués à une collision frontale d’une sévérité d’environ 56 km/h. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Pendant la phase initiale de la collision, un passager qui n’est pas bouclé continue à se déplacer vers l’avant et interagit avec l’arrière du siège du conducteur. Les genoux, la tête et la poitrine du passager à l’arrière peuvent interagir avec le siège du conducteur pendant les stages initiaux de l’impact (Figure 1).

<img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/RearSeatBelts.jpg" />

<strong>Figure 1:</strong> Images pendant les stages initiaux d’une collision frontale (obtenues du test IIHS) – Ces images démontrent un passager assis à l’arrière d’un véhicule et son déplacement lorsqu’il n’est pas bouclé.

Un passager qui n’est pas bouclé et qui est assis à l’arrière d’un véhicule peut devenir un projectile à l’intérieur du véhicule pendant une collision frontale. Leur contact avec le dossier du siège des occupants assis en avant peuvent déformer ces sièges, ce qui augmente le potentiel des blessures corporelle pour ces occupants. La probabilité d’une blessure mortelle peut augmenter par deux fois pour un conducteur assis en avant d’un passager qui n’est pas bouclé, si l’on compare à des collisions similaires où tous les occupants utilisent leurs ceintures de sécurité. <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Aussi, le risque d’une blessure sévère pour un conducteur peut augmenter par huit fois quand assis devant un passager qui n'utilise pas sa ceinture de sécurité, comparé à ceux qui l'utilisent. <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

Récemment, une décision dans « Stewart v. the Corporation of the Township of Douro-Dummer » adresse la responsabilité dans une collision où il y avait des occupants qui n’utilisaient pas leurs ceintures de sécurité dans un taxi. Il y avait quatre passagers dans le taxi quand ils ont été impliqués dans un accident routier. Un des passagers qui n’utilisaient pas sa ceinture de sécurité a été blessé. La question était si le conducteur du taxi était responsable de l'utilisation des ceintures de sécurité des passagers.

La décision, rendue le 26 Juin, 2018, conclu que ce n’était pas la responsabilité du conducteur du taxi d’assurer que les passagers portaient leurs ceintures de sécurité. La décision déclare que même si le conducteur avait une responsabilité, ça serait d’aviser les passagers de porter leur ceinture lorsqu’ils entrent le taxi, mais n’était pas responsable de l’enforcer.

N’importe comment vous vous déplacez en ville, par véhicule personnel ou dans un véhicule comme un taxi, pensez avant d’être un passager non-bouclé. Les passagers qui ne sont pas bouclé mettent eux-mêmes et les autres dans le véhicule à risque élevé de blessure sérieuse.

<a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Collision severity is quantified by the change in velocity, or ‘delta-v’, which is the difference between the pre-impact and post-impact velocity of a vehicle. For example, if a vehicle is stopped and struck from behind such that it is accelerated forward to a speed of 10 km/h, the collision severity would be 10 km/h. In the IIHS test, the vehicle was accelerated rearward up to a speed of 56 km/h to simulate a frontal collision. The delta-v is widely regarded as a good indicator of impact severity in collision reconstruction.

		<content><![CDATA[When someone loses their balance on a stairway, even if they were not initially holding the handrail, they can often successfully grasp it and use it to recover balance because the reaching reaction happens very quickly. However, if someone is holding an object in their hand during a loss of balance, they are likely to preferentially hold onto that object rather than releasing it to grab the handrail.

		<title><![CDATA[Why flip-flops may increase the risk of slips and falls]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Did you know that footwear type can impact the likelihood of recovering from a slip? Research indicates that footwear that is securely attached to the foot (such as a running shoe) demonstrates a lower slip severity than flip-flops when walking over contaminated, slippery floors. What this means is that if a slip is initiated, the pedestrian’s foot may slide farther and faster when walking in flip-flops compared to running shoes, increasing the risk of the slip leading to a fall. Since a flip-flop is not secured to the foot in the same way as lace-up footwear is, there is the added potential for motion between the pedestrian’s foot and the sandal footbed, which could contribute to a loss of balance or impact the recovery response.

		<title><![CDATA[Getting to the Root: Building Damage Caused by Trees]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Trees may be the cause of nuisance for real estate developers and home owners as they may cause damage to roof, foundations and structure. A wealth of literature on court cases exist, in Canada and abroad, to determine legal responsibility for property damage caused by trees. In those cases, in which mitigation measures are deemed futile, it is common that the court grants a mandatory injunction to remove the tree (e.g. Guinan vs. Ottawa, 2010).

The 30 Forensic Engineering <a href="https://www.30fe.com/service/geotechnical-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geotechnical</a> team was recently involved in a forensic investigation on damages to a residential dwelling unit in Toronto caused by a tree. The house, built in the 50’s, started to manifest cracks in the foundation and in the exterior brick walls in the early 2010’s. Some structural works had been carried out ten years earlier, however, our forensic analysis excluded any relationship between the structural works and the observed damage. Our attention was immediately drawn, instead, by the presence of a tall tree in the vicinity of the house (Figure 1).
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-4217 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/VitoRoot1-1-300x169.png" alt="" width="501" height="282" /><strong>Figure 1 – Residential Dwelling in Toronto</strong></h5>
Most trees have roots that extend well beyond the spread of the branches and penetrate deeply into the soil, growing under driveways, sidewalks and foundations as they are attracted by sources of water and air such as broken drain or pipes. While taking up water, they generate significant suction in the soils, especially if these contain expansive clays.

Due to their mineralogical composition and particle aggregation, expansive clays respond to wetting and drying cycles with significant volumetric swelling and shrinkage. If a tree is present in the vicinity of a house founded on expansive soils, the suction generated by the roots near the foundations results in soil shrinkage. Moisture migration under the center of the house, may result in soil swelling and building heave. Such conditions may lead to significant differential settlements and building damage (Figure 2). Water accumulating in concrete cracks in slabs and foundations is subjected to freeze and thaw cycles and causes a progressive deterioration of the concrete with time.
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-4218 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/VitoRoot2.png" alt="" width="425" height="428" /><strong>Figure 2. Differential settlement in expansive soils (Domashiuk, 1986)</strong></h5>
In our investigation, we identified the root cause of the building damage to be soil shrinkage due to tree roots suction. The problem was escalated by the presence of a drain, which had been leaky for many years prior to the manifestation of damage (Figure 3). In addition, the silty clays foundation soils might have caused some heave under the center of the house.

<strong> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4219 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/VitoRoot4-300x128.png" alt="" width="424" height="181" /></strong>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 3. Tree roots uptake of water in leaky drain (Toronto Parks Forestry and Recreation)</strong></h5>
<strong>How to fix the problem</strong>. The first step is identifying the problematic soils. Canada has not produced detailed mapping efforts or hazard maps for expansive soils. However, with the exception of the northern tundra areas of the country, much is known about the location of and expansive potential of the surficial soils over much of the country. Wray (1994) reports that a relatively widespread distribution of soils with high potential for shrink/swell activity is found in Alberta and Saskatchewan and, to a lesser extent, in Manitoba. In Eastern Ontario abundant quantities of swelling clay minerals are found in the soils of the Waterton area, in Central Ontario in Beeton and Wyevale and moderate quantities in Uhthoff, Coldwater, Huntsville and Port Rowan (Guillet, 1977).

Prior to construction of a house, the problem is dealt with by avoiding planting trees near a building or siting a building too close to trees, replacing the upper 60 to 120 cm of the expansive soil with select fill, treating the expansive soils with chemical stabilization or other techniques such as pre-heaving soils by ponding with vertical drains or with lime slurry injection (Mesri and Shahien, 1989).

Remediation and repair of damage caused by shrinkage/swelling soils, on the other hand, is relatively costly, difficult and disruptive. Removing trees in Toronto, for example, requires a certificate from a certified arborist and the written approval of the Commissioner of Economic Development, Culture and Tourism, even if the tree is diseased or dead.  In Ottawa a Four Phase Assessment Process is in place to determine whether the property damage was actually caused by trees and if so, the City is responsible for providing mitigative measures. Cutting the roots may make the tree particularly susceptible to insects and disease attack, which may lead to rotting. This can make the tree structurally unsound over time. Soil treatment by chemical injection may be very expensive.

One solution that is gaining popularity, because of its technical and economic feasibility, is the construction of vertical moisture barriers around the entire perimeter of the house. The barrier is designed to minimize changes in soil moisture content and thus minimize shrinkage and swell of soils and related foundation movements.

And yes, recent years have witnessed a surge in the construction of solar farms, with ground mounted PV arrays harnessing solar energy. But the picture is not all rosy, while the (geotechnical) design of such relatively light weight structures appears to be straightforward, failure to properly design solar panel foundations and, more specifically, to meet the acceptable serviceability (deformation) limits still occurs. In this article, I will be discussing this matter in an attempt to help decision makers (particularly non-geotechnical engineers) have a better understanding of the problem and therefore make well-informed decisions. This includes the common foundation systems supporting ground-mounted solar panels, the typical foundation design deficiencies, and finally some advices to aid in preventing such failures.

<strong><em>Why would I care?</em></strong>

Whether you are a developer, contractor, engineer, insurer or lawyer of any of the beforementioned, have a read of the following quoted lines from the study published by Abduahad et al. in 2010 in the Canadian Geotechnical Journal, where they presented the results of their review of 41 legal cases related to geotechnical engineering in Canada between 1982 and 2006.

<em>“Most claims in geotechnical engineering are caused by ‘‘inaccuracies in the design plans and specifications’’ and ‘‘different soil conditions and recommendations than expected from the geotechnical report.’’</em>

<em>“Canadian courts allowed all the actions made for the claim issue ‘‘owner’s failure to disclose important information.’’</em>

<em>“Canadian courts allowed 83.3% of the actions made against engineers in disputes concerned with ‘‘inaccuracies in the design plans and specifications.’’</em>

<em>“It is worth repeating the conclusions reached by Mirza (1992) that a defence based on exculpatory clauses is at best a weak defence and that a QA/QC practice strategy is required to ensure that errors and omissions are minimized”.</em>

<strong><em>How to support ground mounted solar panels?</em></strong>

The selection of the suitable foundation system to support ground mounted solar panels, and virtually any other structures, depends on many factors including the subsurface conditions, the imposed loads from the supported structure, the environmental conditions, and the site-specific constructability constraints. Generally, the foundation systems used in industry can be grouped in in two broad categories: shallow foundations (e.g. spread footings, strip footings…etc) transferring the loads to the shallow deposits, and deep foundations (also referred to as piles) transferring the loads to the deeper deposits.

Among the latter type, the use of a helical piles seems to be recently gaining an increased popularity in Canada. This popularity may be attributed to its various construction advantages including the quick and quiet installation technique, the limited (if any) soil spoils, the almost vibration-less installation, and the quality control advantage of correlating the piles installation torque to the expected piles axial resistance. Furthermore, helical piles are often able to provide considerable uplift resistance, typically governing the design of solar panels due to, among other sources, the exerted wind pressures on the exposed panels.

<strong><em>So, why does failure happen? (now we’re talking science)</em></strong>

<img class="wp-image-4231 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Solar-1-300x171.png" alt="" width="589" height="336" />
A successful foundation design should not only ensure the structure stability (i.e. avoid collapse), but also be adequately designed to meet the serviceability requirements (i.e. only allows for less deformations than the acceptable limits). While the failure to meet the former seem less common, exceeding the acceptable levels of deformation seems, unfortunately, more frequent.

Personally, I can say that a combination of factors, rather than a single deficient element, mostly result in foundations damage. such factors include poor design, improper construction activities, poor (or lack) of quality control process, the use of improper material, and poor communication between structural and geotechnical engineers, resulting in the application of incompatible design methodologies.

Experience shows that frost related problems present a frequent (if not the most) cause of ground-mounted foundation deficiencies in Canada. To understand how cold weather may affect the stability of foundations, one has to understand some of the interesting features of soils in reaction to temperature change.

Freezing of some soil deposits results in volumetric expansion, ending up in heaving any placed structure on or in this frozen layer. With the temperature rise and frost thawing, the same soil deposits may lose a considerable percentage of its strength possibly ending up with excessive deformation or collapse the structure. Furthermore, strong bond may develop between frozen soil and the embedded foundation, resulting in the latter following the soil movement and ultimately damaging the supported structure.

Another common factor contributing to foundations failure is the erroneous application of design calculations, or the incompatible design methodologies considered by structural and geotechnical engineers. In simpler words, to have a “like for like” comparison the expected applied loads determined by the structural engineer have to be calculated in a comparative methodology to that followed by the geotechnical engineer in estimating the foundations resistance.

Numerous other reasons may result in foundation failure that I may not discuss here for practical reasons. If I had, however, to choose a single last factor to mention, I would focus on the poor subsurface geotechnical investigations. Saving a few thousands on geotechnical subsurface investigations may end up in inaccurate identification of the subsurface profile and possibly inaccurate interpretation of the soil properties. And obviously enough, no merit in applying a proper design methodologies, or using the most sophisticated design software, in absence of accurate subsurface profile identification upfront.

<strong><em>So, how to avoid?</em></strong>

I would first like to remind myself and other geotechnical engineers not to compromise on the quality of their work. Don’t hide behind the “<em>I am not responsible for my work</em>” disclaimers. Additionally, always remember that effective communication with the project structural engineer is of key importance for a successful design.

For owners, developers, and whoever will end up paying the project bill: don’t underestimate the importance of geotechnical engineering work. Down the road, you may end up paying multiples of what you thought have saved on that subsurface investigation or that “quick” design.

As well, always ensure that a well-qualified geotechnical engineer carries out the foundation design. If in doubt, seek the help of an expert to review the work (and needless to say, follow his recommendations).

For contractors…Well, have a read:

“<em>Before taking legal action, it is important that contractors understand that, in general and according to precedent cases, Canadian court decisions do not compensate the contractor for a changed soil condition unless the change is substantial</em>” Abduahad <em>et al</em>.(2010)

		<content><![CDATA[This Statement of Qualification (SOQ) Document outlines <strong>30 Forensic Engineering</strong>’s consulting services related to forensic engineering in the geotechnical and mining disciplines. *<em>Click on the image to the right to view the full service offering.</em>

The <a href="https://www.30fe.com/service/geotechnical-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geotechnical and Mining Group</a> investigates residential, commercial, industrial, heavy civil infrastructure, mining, and natural resource losses on the basis of sound application of science, soil and rock mechanics and, most importantly, our expert engineering knowledge and judgment. Beyond natural forces, the damage that occurs can be the result of inadequate investigation prior to design, limitations in the design approach, construction, or contract issues, and even human factors and error during the construction process.

Our investigations involve shallow or deep excavations, retaining walls, dams, natural or man-made slopes, or underground structures such as transportation tunnels, infrastructure, and mining tunnels. We look at damage to structures caused by settlement, heaving, vibration, or other foundation-related instabilities.

<a href="https://www.30fe.com/service/geotechnical-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-4587 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/GeoImage-300x140.png" alt="" width="621" height="290" /></a>

In the more complex cases, we work in multidisciplinary teams with our in-house specialists in buildings, structures, environment, and materials to provide an unbiased, technical, and factual analysis of the incident, with a goal of helping our clients make educated decisions to achieve a timely resolution.

Over the years, our team has been retained to investigate some of the largest and most complicated assignments in Canada and internationally. Our diligent, thoughtful, and well-communicated reporting continues to strengthen our reputation. As a result, we continue to be retained for increasingly larger and more complex projects worldwide.

Our <a href="https://www.30fe.com/people/?discipline=Geotechnical%20Engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geotechnical and Mining Team</a> has been involved in over 300 cases related to the following areas:

• Natural and man-made slope
• Reinforced slopes (soil nail walls, mechanically stabilized earth walls, etc.)
• Cuts and excavations
• Shoring and retaining walls
• Dams and embankments
• Tailings dams
• Residual soils
• Shallow and deep foundations
• Machine foundations
• Solar farms foundations
• Foundations construction
• Bottom heave failures of deep excavations
• Swelling soils
• Vibration damage to foundations and buildings
• Flooding and drainage damage
• Tunnel damage, grouting losses, settlement, collapse, flooding, and reconstruction
• Sinkholes
• Contamination and soil clean-ups (hydrocarbons, heavy metals road salt)
• Waste repositories (coal, tailings, sediments, etc.)

		<title><![CDATA[Wildfire Smoke Exposure]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[As we watch the wildfire situation in Australia unfold with heavy hearts, it is a good time to think ahead to spring and summer 2020 here in Canada.  According to the Canadian Red Cross, there are roughly 8,000 wildfires in Canada each year. Densely forested areas across much of Canada are at risk of wildfires, particularly during dry conditions. Forest fires can devastate communities, destroy buildings and infrastructure, and even claim human lives. On average in Canada, wildfires burn 2.5 million ha/year, nearly half the size of Nova Scotia.

As we are no strangers to wildfires, and while we have never experienced anything like what is happening in Australia, it is worth re-visiting our own lessons learned.  Wildfires not only threaten lives and property locally but also create incidents of extreme air pollution that can negatively affect the health of populations over vast geographic areas.

Wildfire smoke, which generally contains large amounts of respirable particulate matter, can  increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with existing conditions are particularly susceptible. Respirable particulate matter measured in Edmonton and High Level this past summer were 10-30 times higher than the national guideline.  This was due to wildfires burning in central and northern Alberta.

Wildfires are often large enough to create their own weather patterns.  The heat generated by a large fire can create updrafts sending gasses and combustion by-products/smoke high into the atmosphere creating pyrocumulus clouds. Pyrocumulus clouds are turbulent, fast moving masses that can produce lightening strikes which can start new fires, exacerbating a wildfire situation.

<img class=" wp-image-4766 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/FirePic1-268x300.png" alt="" width="148" height="166" />Once combustion by-products/smoke are high in the atmosphere, they can be transported great distances.  Image 1 was recently taken in Auckland, New Zealand where the sky appeared orange due to smoke from Australian wildfires 2,100 km away. Image 2 was taken outside of Edmonton, Alberta in May 2019 by one of our engineers on their way to conduct smoke impaction assessments. The image shows reduced air quality and visibility due to smoke originating 250-750 km away from the Slave Lake and High Level wildfires.

<img class=" wp-image-4767 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/FIrePic2-300x145.png" alt="" width="288" height="139" />During an extreme air pollution episode, it is recommended to stay indoors to reduce exposure to smoke.  To limit smoke filled air from entering your home, , set ventilation systems to recirculate, upgrade filters, and consider creating a Clean Air Shelter (CAS) in one of the rooms of your home by using a correctly sized HEPA air filtration system.

If it is necessary to go outdoors during an extreme air pollution episode, it is advised that an N95 or P100 particulate respirator be worn.  Click <strong><a href="https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/respiratory-protection-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a></strong> to review an excellent summary from the EPA on how people can help protect themselves if found in such a situation.

		<title><![CDATA[Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis: Approach with a Healthy Degree of Skepticism]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Structural engineers rely heavily on predictions. Unlike other engineering products, building structures cannot make use of a prototype where the “bugs” can be ironed out. In a sense, each building is its own prototype. The dominant method in today’s practice for structural analysis is the Finite Element Analysis method (FEA).

All finite element models are a simplification of reality. Multiple factors affect how close the model and the results are to reality.

There are two types of FEA: linear and nonlinear. In today’s practice, the classic design and assessment of structures usually involves the development of a linear elastic model to calculate the global structural response. A second step may be needed for critical components in which nonlinear analysis may be required. Nonlinear analysis can serve as a valuable tool in forensic analysis supporting origin and cause investigations as well as assessing the expected behaviour of retrofitted structures, or in rationally selecting amongst various repair alternatives.
<h1>Reasons for caution when using nonlinear analysis</h1>
Unlike, say, structural analysis of a statically determinant structure, the application of nonlinear finite element analysis is hardly straightforward. This necessitates that models be developed and results examined with a healthy degree of skepticism and caution.

Sophisticated nonlinear finite element analysis software packages are likely to be used by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest. Analysis software and models should be validated or calibrated against tested specimens.

Analysts must be mindful of that no one approach performs well over the entire range of varying geometrical and loading conditions encountered in practice. Therefore, analysts should carefully select the appropriate approach for the unique situation.

Engineering judgment is a key in nonlinear finite element analysis. Decisions made with respect to selection of material behaviour models, mesh layout, type of element used, support conditions, method of loading, convergence criteria, and selection of material behaviour model will produce a range of results. Prediction competitions between experienced analysts show a variation of the prediction results. More variation is expected with predictions of deflections and deformations just before failure, compared to failure load predictions. Analysts must be aware of the possible effects of each model parameter. A study of the sensitivity of the results to a certain parameter should be insightful.

Crucially, nonlinear finite element analysis is known to yield large amounts of data. Analysts must be aware of what to look for and how to interpret it. Even with experienced analysts, the possibility for misinterpretation cannot be totally eliminated.

In conclusion, nonlinear finite element analysis is a great tool but should only be used by those who understand its capabilities and limitations and approach it with a healthy degree of skepticism and caution.

		<title><![CDATA[Understanding Delta-V]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Delta-v is a widely used term in the world of collision reconstruction but is often misunderstood or unknown entirely by the general public. Rightfully so, it may have no relevance to you unless you’re an insurance adjuster or lawyer trying to establish liability or cost resulting from a vehicle collision.

As collision reconstruction consultants, our clients in the insurance and legal industries call upon us to provide them with the information they require to determine responsibility or liability for a given collision. This typically includes a determination of vehicle speeds at impact, a process that starts by first calculating the collision severity, a term often described and often misunderstood. While the calculation of collision severity can be quite complex and is beyond the scope of this short article, we can describe it here in simple terms so that the reader has a better idea of what it is and how we use it in our assessments.

Collision severity is defined as the change in velocity, or delta-v, from immediately before to immediately after a collision that is experienced by a vehicle. This delta-v occurs over a very short time time frame, typically 0.15 seconds or less — faster than a blink of an eye. To put this in context, we will refer to an example: for its crash worthiness and safety mandate, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash tests vehicles travelling at 56 km/h into a rigid wall (Figure 1); for our example, we’ll assume that it’s 60 km/h. During these tests, the vehicles experience a delta-v of 60 km/h, ignoring any sort of rebound off the wall. In other words, vehicles stop pretty much immediately as they hit the wall. These crash tests typically last for less than a tenth of a second; the collision shown in Figure 1 lasted for about 0.08 seconds.

<img class=" wp-image-4890 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/RaffiDeltaV1-300x173.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="317" />
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: NHTSA crash test of a 2018 Tesla Model 3 into a rigid wall at 56 km/h.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></h5>
The collision described above is considered a very severe collision that happens very fast. As crazy as it may sound, you probably experience a delta-v this high every day. How so? Well, imagine you’re driving your car at 60 km/h down the road and approach a stop light. You slow down and eventually stop for the red light. In this sense, your speed reduced from 60 km/h to zero, and you experienced a changed in velocity (delta-v) of 60 km/h! But you weren’t in a collision, and you didn’t feel any sort of “severe” impact. The difference between this scenario and the crash test example given above is that you probably slowed down to a stop in roughly 8 to 9 seconds. That’s about two orders of magnitude (100x) longer than the crash test impact. So, it’s the time frame that makes the difference. The shorter the time, the more severe the change in velocity. When applied to a collision, the term delta-v is used.

<em>Understanding Discrepancies in Collision Severity</em>

While delta-v refers to collision severity, it is unlikely that both vehicles in a collision will experience the same delta-v. For example, consider a large passenger sedan colliding head-on with a small passenger sedan. Such a collision was tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) (Figure 2), where a Toyota Camry collided with a Toyota Yaris, which it outweighed by about 400 kg. During the test, both vehicles were travelling at the same speed. As a result of the collision, which by-the-way lasted for about 0.15 seconds, the heavier Camry experienced a delta-v that was 21 km/h or 38 % lower than that of the Yaris, even though both vehicles still experienced a severe collision.

<img class=" wp-image-4891 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/RaffiDeltaV2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="310" />
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 2: IIHS head-on crash test between 2009 Toyota (red) &amp; 2009 Toyota Yaris (blue).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></h5>
The reason for the discrepancy in the collision severity in the example above is because the masses of the vehicles were substantially different, and everybody knows that heavier objects are harder to move. The science behind this stems from a phenomenon first explained by Isaac Newton in his first law of motion, the law of inertia, which dictates that heavier objects are more resistant to changes in motion. This simple concept can be used to help insurance and legal folk better understand the severity of collisions, which may affect collision avoidance potential or even the possibility of occupant injury. But that’s another discussion altogether.

		<title><![CDATA[Why Carrying Objects Can Pose a Risk When Responding to a Fall]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Carrying an object while walking, whether a child or a cell phone, can greatly alter the outcome if we lose our balance.  How many times have you attempted to carry all the groceries from the car in one trip, decided you can carry those extra bags for your vacation, or loaded yourself up with that one extra item in the house before you walked down some stairs?  It’s these actions that we all do on a regular basis that put us at an increased risk from effectively responding to a moment of imbalance by being able to brace for a fall.

<img class=" wp-image-4902 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Bioimage-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="246" />A moment of imbalance can encompass several scenarios, often grouped into one of three categories: slips, trips, and missteps; all of which we have faced multiple times throughout our lives.  Slips most often occur when we place our foot on the ground with insufficient friction while walking.  Our foot slides forward and/or to the side, causing us to lose our balance and fall backwards or to the side.  Trips most often occur when our leg swing is interrupted, preventing our foot from arriving where we need it.  Trips occur under a variety of situations, from undetected elevation changes in the sidewalk on your evening walk or tripping over the family pet that just walked between your legs.  Last, missteps are simply any step that is insufficiently placed to accept the weight transfer of your body, which can be especially important when that weight transfer also includes the things you are carrying.

With our hands full carrying loads like groceries, our injury risk may increase due to an increased inability to brace for a fall during moments of imbalance.  By bracing for a fall, an individual has successfully moved their arm to grab onto a railing or contact the ground before the head or pelvis does, thus decreasing the impact force of that fall.  Not bracing for a fall can lead to an increased risk of severe injury consequences.  <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10255840601003551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> has shown that unbraced falls from standing height can lead to upwards of 300 g of acceleration impacting the head.  As a comparison, a <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/11792654/investigation-of-amusement-park-and-rollercoaster-injury-likelihood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> looking at braced falls with the hands used at the last moment before impacting the ground found peak accelerations to the head of only 15.2 g.  That’s a 20x decrease in head impact by simply bracing at the last moment before contacting the ground!  To give an idea on what that means for injuries (e.g., concussion), the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-abstract/53/6/1328/2887895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average</a> acceleration associated with concussion in professional football players was found to be only 98 g.  This highlights just how important bracing becomes in reducing the forces the body experiences when falling.
<p style="text-align: left;">For older adults, the risk of falling is an ever-present danger faced when going about the activities associated with daily living.  The Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) <a href="https://www.cihi.ca/en/exercise-caution-canadians-frequently-injured-in-falls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> seniors (individuals 65 and older) make up 71% of hospital stays due to unintentional falls, with hip fractures the most likely cause of hospitalization.  While it is currently not known how much carrying loads played a role in these studied injuries and hospitalizations, research evidence suggests carrying loads or holding objects certainly plays a role. One <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-003-1815-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> found that individuals exposed to a loss of balance while holding objects preferentially hang onto the object instead of protecting themselves, even when the object they are holding is not helpful in regaining their balance! Simply put, if you start to fall while texting and walking, you are more likely to protect your phone than your own body. It is scientific findings like these that should give us pause when we decide to routinely carry that extra item instead of keeping our hands free.</p>
 It should be noted that the potential risk posed by carrying loads when responding to moments of imbalance is not unique to seniors.  That same CIHI report also stated that while most hospital stays due to unintentional falls may be seniors, individuals younger than 65 years of age make up 72% of emergency department visits due to unintentional falls.  The difference in injury rates has to do with response-ability, as falls from standing height have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021929097001140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enough impact energy</a> to cause hip fractures in young adults, but young adults have an increased ability to rapidly place their hands in a position to brace for impact that results in staving off any major hip injuries.

Whether it be attempting to make just one trip from the car with your groceries, or carrying that extra item down the stairs so you don’t have to make another trip, we should be thinking about what we are trying to accomplish – delivering of an item, posting on Instagram, or arriving safely. While we may often think about falls in terms of overall ability, age, or strength, we often don’t consider the potential negative influence that carrying an object may have on our ability to brace for falls.  At the end of the day, take that extra trip to the car, the extra trip up and down the stairs, or post your selfie while seated, because it may just be what helps prevent serious injury.

Because of this, impartial investigations will continue to be valuable in helping the insurance and legal industry identify the origin and cause of these failures”.

Beyond the fire investigations themselves, we continue to see the need for accurate scoping and assessment – small fires can often result in large impacts, as smoke and soot may travel throughout homes and business especially if ventilation systems are active. Proper definition and remediation of post-fire impacts to finishes and contents is always recommended for hygiene and health &amp; safety reasons, and documentation of the remediation is always consistent with risk management best practices.

As an essential service, our policy is to be an active partner with our clients and other persons who attend joint investigations by working together to overcome the obstacles that prevent timely investigation and delivery of findings. Our work is completed in accordance with our Joint Examinations and Site Work During COVID-19 Policy, which addresses safety concerns and best practices for completing site work, including physical distancing, hand hygiene and PPE.

Our highly-skilled and diverse team of experts provide a unique perspective and profound understanding of how and why fires and explosions occur. Whether the loss is associated with a complex metal refining process, a food processing facility, a commercial HVAC unit or an ordinary space heater, we have the right experts to provide insight into both the cause and broader context of the event. During the course of our investigations, we keep our clients informed of our progress and findings and make sure we meet their timelines for deliverables.

		<title><![CDATA[The Devil is in the Collision Details]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[When collisions occur and insurance claims are being filed, questions pertaining to liability and the damages incurred by the involved parties are usually at the forefront of the case. But what happens when the details of a collision call into question the legitimacy of the collision itself?

Take, for example, a collision claim made regarding a Cadillac that had been T-boned. The provided photographs taken by the repair shop captured damage<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> consistent with a T-bone impact; however, the reported circumstances surrounding the collision raised a few red flags. For instance, the driver reported travelling with four passengers but was unable to recall the names of the occupants he was travelling with. The collision occurred in the early morning hours at a relatively isolated industrial park. The driver reported travelling around 30 km/h through an intersection when his vehicle was struck by an unidentified SUV that ran a stop sign and then fled the scene. Despite the relatively serious nature of the collision, the driver did not call the police.

<img class=" wp-image-4983 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Fig1-295x300.png" alt="" width="350" height="356" />With an increasing number of fraudulent claims being filed, insurance companies have started to take action to minimize illegitimate claim payouts. One way that this is done is through working with collision reconstruction experts on fraudulent claims. Our experience with vehicle collisions and our expertise with interpreting vehicle damage allow us to test the validity of the reported circumstances against scientific principles which govern the collision.

In the case of our T-bone example, while the damage may have appeared consistent with the reported information at first glance (Figure 1), the surrounding details were suspicious enough to obtain an expert examination and opinion on the likely physical circumstances surrounding this collision.
<h3>Fraudulent Vehicle Claims</h3>
During our vehicle examination of the Cadillac, we observed a partial imprint on the right rear door that matched the features of a vehicle grille; something which had not been previously visible in the photographs taken by the repair shop. Based on the size and shape of the imprint, we determined that the striking vehicle was most likely a third generation Chevrolet Equinox.

More notably, however, were the vertical as opposed to horizontal scratches within the imprint. This small detail indicated a rather large discrepancy between the driver’s reported speed and the actual speed at impact. Take, for example, a stamp imprint on a piece of paper. If we hold the stamp steady while pulling the paper away, the ink will smear in the direction the paper is pulled. Similarly, if the Chevrolet’s grille struck the side of a Cadillac that was moving across its front, we would expect horizontal scratches from the front of the Chevrolet to form on the side of the Cadillac.

The lack of any significant horizontal scratching on the Cadillac indicated that it was stationary at impact. The vertical scratches, however, were an indication that the Cadillac moved up and down against the front of the Chevrolet; a result of the Cadillac being rocked on its suspension as a result of the impact.

<img class=" wp-image-4984 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Fig2-300x133.png" alt="" width="600" height="266" />
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 2: View of the grille imprint on the Cadillac (left) compared with the grille of a third-generation Chevrolet Equinox (right)</strong></h6>
<img class=" wp-image-4985 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Fig3-300x122.png" alt="" width="600" height="244" />
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 3: View of the motion of the Cadillac rocking back and forth on the suspension to create the observable imprint.</strong></h6>
We also imaged the vehicle’s event data recorder (EDR) or ‘black box’ – a device that is capable of capturing collision related data such as vehicle speed, throttle, or brake application, as well as airbag deployment commands. The data within the device confirmed what the damage already suggested: that the Cadillac was stationary for the 5 seconds preceding the collision.

Furthermore, while the side curtain airbags appeared deployed, the EDR indicated it had never commanded the deployment. The vehicle headliner was not torn in a manner reflective of natural airbag deployment, and after testing the electrical continuity, we confirmed the airbags had been physically drawn from the vehicle and were not deployed as a result of the impact.

Our examination of the vehicle damage indicated that the Cadillac was stationary when it had been struck and that the side curtain airbags had been artificially drawn from the vehicle. This evidence was inconsistent with what the driver reported and therefore suggested that the Cadillac was likely involved in a staged collision.
<h3>Misrepresented Vehicle Claims</h3>
Of course, not every contentious claim is going to be an elaborately staged collision. Damage can also be mispresented in the hopes that the insured will receive a payout without the penalty of increased premiums for purposeful damage. These claims often present as ‘hit and run’ cases, where the owner alleges or believes another vehicle struck their vehicle while it was left unattended, when in fact, the vehicle actually struck a stationary object like a parking bollard. These types of collisions are typically of low severity, and therefore, any collision related data that might otherwise have been captured by the EDR, is left unrecorded.

To complicate the matter, vehicle-related damage and object-related damage can be confused for one another if careful examination of the damage isn’t undertaken (Figure 4). It is therefore crucial to remain critical of what can be readily seen in provided photographs and to be mindful of what the specific damage attributes tells us in their entirety.

<img class=" wp-image-4986 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Fig4-300x102.png" alt="" width="600" height="204" />
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 4: View of damage from a vehicle (left) compared with damage from a
parking bollard (right)</strong></h6>
For example, the texture and depth of damage, the consistency and appearance of any external deposits, and any paint transfer that may exist can help identify if the damage is vehicle related.  Changes in the directionality of the damage can also help determine if a vehicle was stationary or moving when the damage occurred and assist in determining if the reported information is legitimate.

Vehicle-related damage can also cause varying degrees of damage because vehicle bodies deform as they come into contact with each other. Evidence of vehicle-related damage can include areas of smooth wavy damage and black tire-shaped scuffs (Figure 5, left image).

In contrast, a vehicle exhibits different damage characteristics when it strikes a rigid (stationary) object. This can include scratches and scuffs that are sharp, linear, and similar in appearance and texture to course-grit sandpaper. Oftentimes, rigid objects create uniquely horizontal patterns, where the damage appears visually consistent throughout the area of damage. This is because stationary objects, like concrete pillars or parking bollards, do not deform when scraped against, so the force applied as a vehicle moves past these types of objects remains consistent.

<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 5: View of vehicle related damage (left) compared to rigid object damage (right).</strong></h6>
<h3>Site Examinations</h3>
Some cases (if investigated in a timely manner) also benefit from having the expert attend the collision site. For example, in cases where drivers have struck their vehicles against rigid objects (whether knowingly or not) evidence of vehicle contact exhibited by vehicle paint can remain against the struck surface. Being able to locate and identify the exact object that caused the damage provides irrefutable physical evidence that can be relied upon when assessing the validity of the reported circumstances.

<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 6: View of the damage to a vehicle caused by a parking pillar (left) compared with the paint transfer found on a parking pillar in the reported area (right).</strong></h6>
<h3>Summary</h3>
When it comes to identifying fraudulent or misrepresented claims, correctly identifying and interpreting the physical evidence is of utmost importance. The physical evidence, whether it be the damage characteristics, the information within the vehicle’s EDR, or the evidence left at the collision site, tells a compelling story. This evidence allows experts to apply sound scientific principles to determine factors like vehicle speeds, object type, and even driver behaviour, all of which can be compared against the reported events.

In the end, regardless of whether a collision is staged, or the damage is simply misrepresented, the physical evidence left in the wake of an impact will always paint an honest, unbiased picture of what really happened.

		<title><![CDATA[Fraudulent Collision Claims in the Aftermath of COVID-19]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Experience has taught us that significant economic recession or industry policy changes can have a direct effect on the number of fraudulent collision claims. For example, we saw a surge of fraudulent collision claims in the aftermath of the 2008 recession and in response to insurance industry reforms in 2010, attributed to fraud rings. In 2014, some estimates put the cost of fraudulent claims as high as $1.6 billion.<a href="#_ftn4">[1]</a>

<img class=" wp-image-5091 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/fraudimage-300x196.png" alt="" width="220" height="144" />With the effects of COVID-19 expected to reach record levels and lead to unprecedented economic fallout, there is little doubt that the insurance industry will see a surge in fraudulent claims. The imposed lockdown on the economy and mandatory social distancing, while effective and necessary to combat the virus, has already led to job losses and public disenfranchisement. This may result in some folks resorting to desperate measures in an attempt to regain what they’ve lost, leading to opportunistic fraud, and others to take advantage of the system by more nefarious means, such as staged collisions or through the resurgence of fraud rings. We may very well see a surge in potentially fraudulent cases exceed what the industry currently experiences.

In any event, just as society has taken steps to prepare for the COVID-19 virus and has embraced efforts to ‘flatten the curve,’ so too must the insurance and legal industries prepare for the looming threat of fraudulent claims. As an expert, it is therefore imperative to maximize the use of the latest tools available to be able to differentiate between fraudulent claims and legitimate ones. Using specialized expertise, experience, and technology will be key in discerning fact from fiction. Hiring the right expert will prove invaluable in determining the nature of the incident while maintaining objectivity and fairness to ensure that would-be fraudsters do not take advantage of the system.
<h3>Investigating Modern Day Fraudulent Collision Claims</h3>
As collision reconstruction experts, we consult our clients on a wide variety of collision scenarios. Pedestrian impacts, low-speed rear-enders, intersection collisions, and centerline crossings make up just a portion of the types of collision scenarios we investigate. Such investigations typically focus on liability and who is at fault for the collision, and the collision itself is generally accepted as a fact.

One of the more contentious types of investigations we undertake are those relating to suspected <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_T1WQRd_VR0-UTS-wLkKNMw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fraudulent collision claims</a>. In these cases, we are tasked to determine if a collision occurred as reported, if at all. In other words, the claim is suspected as potentially disingenuous, and therefore, open to denial. Denied claims of this type can be challenged in courtroom settings; surely, nobody wants to be labelled as a ‘fraudster,’ whether this be true or false.

Suspected fraudulent investigations require an additional level of expertise and experience as they can differ from traditional forms of collision reconstruction. When trying to identify the nature of a vehicle’s interaction with other vehicles or objects, attention to detail is of utmost importance.

Having investigated hundreds of suspected fraudulent collisions, we have identified several possible incident types, each with their own unique characteristics. These incident types are listed below:
<ol>
 	<li>Intentionally staged collisions (i.e., fake collisions and fraud rings);</li>
 	<li>Intentionally staged collisions with innocent third parties. These are real collisions that are set up by fraudsters to target an innocent person (i.e., ‘swoop’ in front of another vehicle and intentionally hit th7e brakes so that their vehicle is rear-ended, then blame the innocent party and initiate an injury claim);</li>
 	<li>Real collisions that are intentionally misrepresented (i.e., an individual is involved in a collision but reports it as a ‘hit-and-run’);</li>
 	<li>Real collisions that are honestly reported as a ‘<a href="https://www.30fe.com/insight/the-devil-is-in-the-collision-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hit-and-run</a>’ (i.e., an individual unknowingly damages their car, then reports it as a ‘hit-and-run’);</li>
 	<li>Disingenuous injury claims arising out of rear-end collisions (often relating to low-speed collisions); and</li>
 	<li>Theft or vandalism claims.</li>
</ol>
The role of the expert is to dispassionately opine on the causes of vehicle damage and the physical circumstances surrounding an incident. The validity of the reported circumstances is tested against the physical evidence. In this sense, experts should not formulate opinions regarding intent; that should be left for the triers of fact to decide.

Fortunately, there are several methods that can be used to identify the validity of such reported claims, ranging from traditional collision reconstruction techniques to using the latest technologies, examples of which are described below:
<h3>Hi-Tech Methods</h3>
Two technologies lend themselves particularly well to investigating suspected fraudulent claims, and both methods have been developed to access data recorded by vehicles.

The first of these technologies, the Bosch Crash Data Retrieval system,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a> accesses a vehicle’s event data recorder or ‘EDR’ (also known as a ‘black box,' as seen in Figure 1). EDR’s have been integrated into vehicles since the 1990s but have pervaded the automotive industry only in recent years. These devices are a secondary function of a vehicle’s airbag control module (responsible for deploying airbags, when necessary). When a collision occurs, a snippet of vehicle- and impact-related data is captured and recorded by the EDR, including parameters such as speed and brake application in the moments before. While this information can be volatile or stored permanently, it can provide investigators with valuable information to aid in reconstructing collision circumstances.

<img class=" wp-image-5089 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/EDR-300x227.png" alt="" width="600" height="454" />
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: View of an airbag control module from a passenger vehicle. This module's secondary function is an event data recorder (EDR) to capture collision related information.</strong></h5>
The second technology, the Berla iVe system,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[3]</a> is a more recent technological advancement compared to the EDR. This system was initially developed to retrieve data from stand-alone GPS units, but has since been rejigged and repurposed to access information from vehicle ‘infotainment’ systems (Figure 2). Infotainment systems are now common in the automotive industry and are expected by modern day consumers to be present even in the base models of passenger vehicles. These systems act as a central hub for various vehicle controls, information, and entertainment, hence the name.

Unbeknownst to most people, infotainment systems record a variety of vehicle data as well as personal data that is almost always permanently recorded to memory. In a sense, your vehicle ‘knows’ a lot about you. Of particular interest, date-stamped GPS data can be captured, which can provide insight into where a vehicle is on a given date and time.

Once a mobile device or media player is connected to an equipped vehicle, other data can be automatically uploaded and stored, including contact logs and media playlists. Infotainment systems can also automatically store call logs, test messages, and media (such as videos).

Pro-tip: Be mindful about connecting your mobile device next time you rent a vehicle; your personal data is likely to be uploaded to the vehicle’s infotainment system and left for others to discover.

		<title><![CDATA[Even Retaining Structures Need Support – Design and Assessment Perspectives from a Forensic Engineer]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Retaining structures are used to laterally support (hold back) material, typically soil, and allow for a difference in grade elevation by preventing the material from eroding or sliding. Retaining structures are designed to resist the pressures of the retained materials, support loads imposed on the retained soil surface, and in some cases, support buildings or other structures. For instance, abutment walls can be used to provide support for bridges and traffic underpasses as well as to retain the ground at the approaches. Alternatively, retaining walls can be as simple as basement foundation walls, used to laterally support the ground while supporting a building above. There are numerous applications of retaining structures, including shoring of building excavations, retaining of soil and water for marine structures such as docks, underground structures such as tanks, building foundations, among others.

It should be noted that a great deal of planning is required for the establishment of retaining structures as there are varying factors that need to be considered, and multiple modes of failure that can occur. Further, when considering the cause of failure of retaining structures, there is room for improvement in the industry through regulation. Considering the vast range of structural configurations, materials, and site conditions, improving regulations related to the design, approval, and construction of retaining structures can prevent failures and ensure safety.

Forensic engineers investigate structural and geotechnical failures, including those of retaining structures. During any forensic investigation, structural and geotechnical experts review design and construction records, perform site examinations and testing if required, identify factors that contributed to the failure, and analyze possible failure modes to determine the cause of the retaining structure’s failure.  Based on their knowledge and expertise, forensic engineers can identify deficiencies that can be traced back to the design or construction process.

In this article, I will discuss the importance of analyzing the possible modes of failure as part of the design and assessment of retaining structures, the possible factors that can contribute to a failure, and the importance of sound regulations and proper expertise (e.g., structural and geotechnical) for the assessment, analysis, or design of retaining structures.

Retaining structures can be constructed of concrete (reinforced or unreinforced), masonry, wood, steel, or reinforced soil. In terms of geometry and configuration, there are many types of retaining walls, including gravity or cantilever walls, mechanically stabilized earth walls, temporary or permanent sheet pile walls, braced walls such as bridge abutments or basement walls, laterally restrained walls with tiebacks or anchored bulkheads, and crib walls. Therefore, multiple failure modes need to be analyzed in detail to ensure the stability and structural integrity of the system. In the case of existing structures, the assessment must consider varying factors and site conditions that may trigger or contribute to a failure mechanism.
<h1>Types of Failure Modes</h1>
In general, the proper engineering expertise, such as from a structural and/or geotechnical engineer, shall be assigned to assess an existing retaining wall or to perform the design of a new retaining structure.  In the case of large and complex projects, it is essential to engage qualified structural and geotechnical professional engineers and contractors to analyze all possible failure modes. For instance, instability of a retaining system can result in failure mechanisms such as sliding, overturning, bearing failure, or overall slope instability (Figures 1 to 4).

<img class=" wp-image-5130 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/PabloArticle1-300x296.png" alt="" width="550" height="542" />

Failure of retaining structures also occur when structural components are overstressed, and the capacity of the materials to resist internal forces is exceeded (Figures 5 to 10). For instance, retaining walls may exhibit a shear failure at the base with cracking of concrete or dislodging of masonry blocks. A flexural failure due to bending may occur and cause cracking, crushing, and spalling of concrete, and yielding of reinforcement steel.  Failure of tiebacks or mechanical stabilization systems can result in catastrophic failures due to a failure of their structural components (e.g., tensile failure of tie-rods or pullout of anchors). Failure of connections or joints between wall sections can also contribute to a failure of the system (e.g., connections between framing or bracing elements, failure of shear keys or dowels). In general, a proper assessment shall include a detailed structural analysis of the retaining system and its components.

<img class=" wp-image-5131 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/PabloArticle2-300x292.png" alt="" width="552" height="538" />

<img class=" wp-image-5132 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/PabloArticle3-300x145.png" alt="" width="549" height="265" />

Investigating the site-specific conditions and performing geotechnical studies and testing can be critical to achieving a safe design or to accurately assess an existing retaining structure. Site-specific data is gathered to verify assumptions and parameters and to identify unforeseen conditions that can be the cause of a failure. For instance, changes in soil properties along the length of a retaining structure may cause differential settlements or sinking of wall sections. Also, if local faults are present across retaining structures, they can cause relative vertical displacements between sections and damage such as cracking of concrete, failure of joints or connections, and deterioration.
<h1>Factors that Contribute to the Failure of Retaining Structures</h1>
In the case of a retaining structure failure, a thorough forensic investigation shall be performed. Qualified experts such as structural and geotechnical professional engineers, assigned to the investigation, identify and analyze the contributing factors of the failure, which vary from incident to incident.

Although case-specific, contributing factors may include:
<ol>
 	<li>Incomplete or deficient design (e.g., if the design neglected to consider all possible failure modes such as global instability or structural failure);</li>
 	<li>Incomplete, deficient, or erroneous site-specific data (e.g., lack of geotechnical investigation);</li>
 	<li>Change of the use of the area adjacent to the retaining wall (e.g., additional surcharge load);</li>
 	<li>A lack of or improper drainage;</li>
 	<li>Construction deficiencies;</li>
 	<li>Impact or vibration (e.g., vehicle impact);</li>
 	<li>Extreme weather events (e.g., changes to water table levels, flooding, higher hydrostatic pressure);</li>
 	<li>Increased pressures due to frost action;</li>
 	<li>Deterioration due to lack of maintenance (e.g., corrosion of reinforcement); and</li>
 	<li>Unforeseen seismic activity.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Regulations</h1>
The design and construction of retaining walls are regulated by building codes, local regulations by the authority having jurisdiction (such as municipal bylaws), industry standards including structural, geotechnical, materials and manufacturing standards, and best practices.

According to the 2012 Ontario Building Code (OBC), Clause 1.1.2.2. (2), “<em>a retaining wall exceeding 1000 mm </em>[one meter]<em> in exposed height</em> <em>and adjacent to, (i) public property, (ii) access to a building, or (iii) private property to which the public is admitted”</em> is a designated structure and requires a structural design. However, retaining walls on private properties are currently not regulated by the OBC. Certain municipalities in Ontario would not accept or review any design or construction records related to retaining walls on a private property where the public is not admitted, even if a request is presented before construction.

<img class=" wp-image-5133 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/PabloArticle4-300x239.png" alt="" width="360" height="287" />As a forensic engineer, I have witnessed cases where the failure of a retaining wall on private property caused significant material damage and had the potential to cause injury or death (Figure 11). In some cases, it was clear that the design was inadequate, while in others, the construction deficiencies revealed a lack of quality assurance and control.  In my opinion, retaining walls on private properties should be regulated to ensure proper design and approval before construction, as well as be reviewed by an engineer during construction. Future regulation improvements may also include minimum requirements for the design and construction of the different types of retaining structures as well as limitations related to the type of material and system (e.g., height, slenderness, etc.).

Retaining structures can exhibit varying failure mechanisms, and failures can be caused by a variety of factors. Analyzing the possible modes of failure is paramount during the design or assessment of a retaining structure. Further, even when considering the different structural configurations, materials, and varying site conditions (depending on the location), retaining structures require sound regulations to prevent failures and ensure safety. The analysis, design, construction, or assessment of retaining walls requires qualified experts such as structural and geotechnical professional engineers to ensure a safe design or a successful investigation. The betterment of current regulations related to the location, material limitations, and type of retaining structural system is possible and can reduce the risk of failure of retaining structures in the future.

		<title><![CDATA[Is Concussion a Likely Injury Outcome from a Low Speed Read End Collision?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[At 30 Forensic Engineering, our biomechanics experts are frequently retained to investigate whether a concussion is likely to occur during a low speed rear end collision.

<img class=" wp-image-5172 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Chad7-300x213.png" alt="" width="320" height="227" />Clinical assessments of concussion are typically based on subjective symptom reporting and patient history, making it difficult to objectively confirm or refute a causal link between a concussion diagnosis and a motor vehicle collision. Loss of consciousness, a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and positive diagnostics (e.g., medical imaging studies) are rarely present in cases of reported concussion. Additionally, when formulating a clinical impression, most medical professionals have a limited understanding of the severity of the head exposure a patient experienced.

Because of these limitations, acceleration-based head injury metrics can be useful for quantitatively evaluating the severity of the head impact during the collision.

What follows is a summary of some of the recent published literature that should be considered when evaluating whether a concussion is likely to have occurred in a low speed rear end collision.
<h3><strong>Occupant Motion – Initially Rearward</strong></h3>
During a rear impact collision, occupants in the vehicle will initially move rearward relative to their seat. Essentially, they sink back into their seat as the vehicle is driven forward beneath them. Their motion into the seat will compress the padding and may cause temporary rearward bending of the seatback itself.

Later in the collision, the seatback will return to its initial position, pushing the occupant forward. This results in a ‘rebound’ of the occupant within the vehicle. During this rebound phase, the locking mechanism of the seatbelt typically engages, limiting the extent of an occupant’s forward motion.

For properly restrained occupants, contact with forward structures in the vehicle (such as the steering wheel or dashboard) is not expected to occur during low speed rear end collisions - head contact is limited to the padded headrest.
<h3><strong>Peak Head Exposure  – Acceleration-Based Head Injury Metrics</strong></h3>
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has conducted sled tests (i.e., simulated rear impact collisions) for the last decade with a properly restrained, 50th percentile male Biofidelic Rear Impact Dummy (BioRID II) instrumented to evaluate the crashworthiness of head restraints and the dynamic safety ratings of automotive seats (Figure 1). The peak acceleration of these sled tests, which are ongoing, is 10 g, and the duration of the collision pulse is approximately 90 milliseconds (ms; i.e., faster than the blink of an eye). These tests are intended to simulate a 20 mph (approximately 32 km/h) rear-end collision with another vehicle of the same weight, which results in a collision severity or ‘delta-v’ of approximately 16 km/h.

A recent study by Courtney et al. [1] examined the head accelerations recorded from the BioRID II during 34 rear impact sled tests conducted by the IIHS from 2009 to 2017 with 10 passenger car models that were leading in sales in 2017 (including the Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla, Honda Accord and Honda Civic). The average peak resultant linear acceleration was 21.4 g (with a range of 13.6 to 27.3 g). The authors noted that this value was associated with a negligible risk of concussion according to contemporary concussion risk curves, discussed in more detail below.

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Figure 1: Still-frame image (pre-test) from the IIHS Test No. SER17016, which was conducted with a BioRID II dummy in the front seat of a 2019 Toyota Camry.</h5>
To give these values context, we can look at non-injurious activities where head impacts occur, such as heading a soccer ball. In youth soccer, this activity has been shown to result in head acceleration levels ranging from 4.5 to 62.9 g, with many impacts resulting in accelerations in excess of 20 g [2]. This means that the peak head exposure during low speed rear end collisions is comparable to what the head experiences during a routine game of youth soccer.

A similar paper by Scanlon et al. [3]  further examined the head acceleration data from the IIHS rear impact testing. Data from 601 simulated rear impact sled tests on 2014 to 2018 model year vehicles were analyzed, with an average collision severity of 15.6 ± 0.26 km/h. Findings from this work demonstrate that reductions in the Head Injury Criterion (HIC<sub>15</sub>), which considers both the peak magnitude and duration of head accelerations recorded from the BioRID II, were observed across model years. Put simply, vehicles seem to be improving in terms of reducing the head accelerations in rear-end collisions.

For reference, the distribution of HIC<sub>15 </sub>values across model years examined is reproduced as Figure 2. Based on Scanlon et al.’s study data, the highest HIC<sub>15</sub> score from the IIHS sled tests over the last 10 years resulted in less than a 1% risk of concussion.

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: Cumulative distribution of Head Injury Criterion Values (HIC<sub>15</sub>) across simulated rear impact collisions conducted by the IIHS from 2014 to 2018 (Source: Scanlon et al.).</h5>
Similar findings have been presented in a recent study by Pasquesi et al. [4], who conducted full-scale crash tests with two 2014 Honda Accords occupied with restrained and instrumented 50th percentile adult male anthropomorphic test dummies (known as ATDs). In total, four crash tests were conducted that resulted in rear-end collision severities ranging from 5.6 km/h to 19.5 km/h. The study found the following:
<ol>
 	<li>Head Injury Criterion (HIC<sub>15</sub>) values ranged from 2 to 54.6.</li>
 	<li>Peak resultant linear head accelerations ranged from 7.9 g to 28 g.</li>
 	<li>Peak resultant rotational head accelerations ranged from 274 rad/s<sup>2</sup> to 946 rad/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ol>
Based on these findings, the authors concluded that the head acceleration-based injury metrics were low and corresponded to a negligible risk of concussion.

The authors plotted the peak acceleration-based head injury metrics from the staged low speed collisions on concussion risk curves from the published literature, which have been reproduced as Figure 3 and Figure 4.

There have been several head acceleration-based risk curves for concussion proposed in the published biomechanics literature, which collectively are based on thousands of head impacts, including both concussion cases and controls. And while the 50th percentile risk of concussion across the different risk curves varies considerably (ranging from approximately 80 g to 233 g), the abovementioned data from the IIHS simulated collisions corresponds to less than a 5% risk of concussion according to the most conservative model (Figure 5).

The max head acceleration from the IIHS sled tests (28 g) corresponds to a 4% risk of concussion according to the most conservative model.</h5>
A previous study by Elkin et al. [7] compared head acceleration data from both rear-end collisions and impacts to the rear of a football helmet using a numerical computer model of the human brain [8].

For the rear-end crash tests, 19 different vehicles were towed rearward into a rigid barrier resulting in collision severities ranging from 9.3 km/h to 17.6 km/h. An instrumented 50th percentile male ATD occupied the driver’s seat and wore a snug lap and shoulder seatbelt for each test.

In contrast, the football helmet impacts were performed using a horizontal linear impactor that struck a football helmet fitted onto a load-sensing 50th percentile male ATD headform. Simulated head impacts were performed at speeds of 19.8 km/h to 33.5 km/h across three different locations on the head: (i) a low rear location with the neck base flexed forward, (ii) a high rear location with the neck base extended rearward, and (iii) an off-centre rear location with the neck base extended rearward and axially rotated.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-5186 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Chad8-300x293.png" alt="" width="300" height="293" />Data regarding the motion of the head (i.e., peak linear acceleration, peak angular acceleration, peak angular velocity, etc.) from each of the rear impact crash tests and football helmet impacts were input into a numerical computer model of the brain, which quantified the magnitude and distribution of the predicted strain in the brain tissue.

Results from the simulated rear-impact collisions demonstrate that the ATD experienced peak linear and angular head accelerations that varied from 12.1 to 42.0 g and 414 to 1,901 rad/s<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The authors reported that the highest brain strain during the rear-impact collisions:

“<em>Occurred in test 3.6, a 15 km/h speed change in a 1998 Toyota Corolla </em>[...] <em>with the head restraint in the down position.</em> <em>This strain (average, 14%; 90<sup>th</sup> percentile, 22.0% for the whole brain) was accompanied by the highest change in angular velocity (46.1 rad/s) and occurred when the head extended over the top of the head restraint and the occiput struck the top of the head restraint.</em>”

The authors reported that test 3.6 from this study “<em>generated peak brain strains similar to those estimated for a 9.3-m/s </em>[33.5 km/h] <em>football impact, a level that represented the average impact speed for 25 reconstructed concussion in professional football.</em>” However, the peak linear (28.8 g) and angular (1,901 rad/s<sup>2</sup>) head accelerations measured in test 3.6 were considerably lower than the outputs that resulted from the 33.5 km/h impacts to the rear of a football helmet, which resulted in peak linear head accelerations ranging from 84 to 119 g (i.e., approximately three to four times  greater than test 3.6) and 4,718 to 6,036 rad/s<sup>2 </sup>(i.e., approximately two to three times greater than test 3.6), respectively.

For reference, a comparison of the linear and rotational head acceleration traces from case 3.6 and the simulated football head impacts are shown in Figure 6. It is notable that the football head impacts resulted in significantly greater magnitudes of peak linear and rotational head accelerations that were applied over a much shorter duration. It is clear that despite the findings in the study, the head impacts in the two scenarios were not comparable.

Overall, a comparison of the expected accelerations and those associated with concussion indicates that the peak linear and rotational head accelerations typically experienced during low speed rear impact collisions are well below the published threshold levels associated with cases of medically diagnosed concussion.

HR represents the time of head restraint contact during the rear impact collision; SS is the point where the football helmet simulation was stopped because of secondary contact.

<h3><strong>History of Concussions and Tolerance to Head Impact</strong></h3>
Previous research conducted by Guskiewicz et al. [9] has demonstrated that a history of concussions may be associated with an increased risk of future concussive injuries, with those study participants with one diagnosed prior concussion being 40% more likely to sustain a subsequent concussion than those with no concussion history.

However, the published biomechanical data does not allow for a quantitative scaling (if any is required) of the injury tolerance based on this history. It is possible that occupants with a history of concussion are more susceptible due to their history. However, the reduction in their tolerance to head impact would have to be significant (a reduction of more than 70%) for their head contact with the padded headrest to cause a concussion.
<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
For healthy individuals with no prior history of head injury, the peak head accelerations experienced during low speed rear impact collisions are well below the published threshold associated with concussion.

		<title><![CDATA[Wildfire Smoke Exposure - UPDATE]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we watched the bushfire situation in Australia unfold, and now we observe major wildfires along the Pacific coast of the United States with heavy hearts. In Canada, it’s estimated that approximately 8,000 wildfires happen each year. Many of the fires occur in the densely forested areas during dry conditions and can devastate communities, destroy buildings and infrastructure, and claim human lives.

<img class=" wp-image-5246 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/BCSmokeImage1-209x300.png" alt="" width="235" height="337" />According to <a href="https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Wildfire Situation Report</a>, 2020 has been one Canada’s quietest years for forest fires since the 1990s. However, the western provinces were not able to completely escape them this year as significant fire events have occurred in the Penticton and Vancouver areas. In addition, this region is currently affected by smoke from the massive wildfires that are burning in California, Oregon, and Washington states.

A similar situation occurred last summer with respirable particulate matter measured in Edmonton 10-30 times higher than the national guidelines.  This was due to wildfires burning in central and northern Alberta many hundreds of kilometers away.

According to British Columbia’s <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/data/aqhi-table.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air Quality Health Index readings,</a> the levels in the Metro Vancouver area, the Fraser Valley, Nanaimo and southern Vancouver Island are currently listed at 10+, or “very high risk”, as a consequence of the current US wildfires.

Wildfire smoke, which generally contains large amounts of respirable particulate matter, has travelled up the west coast and impacted the air quality and visibility in many western communities. Once combustion by-products/smoke are high in the atmosphere, they can be transported great distances.  Sadly, fine particles that are most damaging to human health are easily able to travel large distances and are more difficult to protect against.

<img class=" wp-image-5247 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/BCSmokeImage2.png" alt="" width="301" height="179" />To protect against exposure to ambient smoke and soot from wildfires, it is typically recommended to remain indoors and rely on the building envelope to prevent unfiltered air from entering an indoor space and the filtration of your home’s HVAC system to remove the majority of particles in the indoor air. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is desire – especially in Canada as winter approaches – to maximize time spent outdoors and to encourage high rates of fresh air ventilation to indoor spaces. Measures community members have already taken to protect themselves from the COVID-19 virus such as wearing masks and frequently cleaning surfaces will also help to reduce exposure to harmful atmospheric condition resulting from wildfires.

In addition to these measures, we recommend implementing these proactive steps to reduce your exposure to airborne contaminants inside your home and/or workplace during the pandemic and episodes of poor outdoor air quality:
<ol>
 	<li>Upgrading and improving the filters in your HVAC system to MERV 13 filters if you have a sufficiently powerful fan;</li>
 	<li>Set ventilation systems to recirculate; and</li>
 	<li>Consider creating a Clean Air Shelter (CAS) in one or more of the rooms in your home/workspace:
-Maintain tight sealing windows and doors
-Using a portable HEPA air filtration machines to remove fine particulate
-Include carbon-based air filters to remove odours and other misc. contaminants</li>
</ol>
Take care using electronic air filtration devices as some of these produce ozone as a by-product which can be hazardous to furniture, fixtures and human health.

If it is necessary to go outdoors during an extreme air pollution episode, it is advised that an N95 or P100 particulate respirator be worn, though these may be difficult to obtain due to the high demand in the medical community related to COVID-19 needs.

COVID-19 precautions include ventilation of indoor spaces with as much outside air as possible. However, there is a trade-off as employers may be required to reduce outside air supply to indoor spaces for Occupational Health and Safety reasons related to high risk Air Quality Health Index readings. Therefore, when you enter indoor public spaces, such as grocery stores, during extreme air pollution episodes, be sure to practice or exceed COVID-19 Public Health safety measures to help protect yourself and others.

There are resources available for those looking for more specific guidance, including an excellent <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/respiratory-protection-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">summary from the EPA</a> on how people can help protect themselves if found in such a situation as well as <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidance from ASHRAE</a> regarding ventilation systems.

Stay tuned for part 2 which will address this issue from an Occupational Health and Safety perspective.

		<title><![CDATA[Innovative Technologies for Assessing Vehicle Collision Claims]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The field of collision reconstruction has been around for decades, and it has advanced insomuch that it is now commonly employed when investigating insurance claims and in litigation. A significant amount of that growth has been within the last decade; the era of smart devices and emerging technologies. While traditional mathematics and physics still underpin the methodologies used in our day-to-day work, the technologies used in our investigations have improved by leaps and bounds. Computer simulations allow faster and more accurate calculations than when done by hand, event data recorders (‘black boxes’) reveal vital collision-related data, and 3D laser scanning allows for the creation of virtual environments. It is therefore paramount that collision reconstruction experts keep up-to-date with the latest technology to provide the most accurate and reliable collision assessments possible.

Two recent innovations make use of in-vehicle technologies that further our understanding of vehicle movements and behaviour, not only in relation to a collision, but also throughout a vehicle’s lifetime. These innovations are telematics/infotainment systems in general, and a Toyota specific technology called Toyota Vehicle Control History.
<h2><strong>Telematics and Infotainment Systems</strong></h2>
Telematics and infotainment (T/I) systems are the latest candidates for data imaging due to the role they play as entertainment centres, communication hubs, and GPS-based navigation systems (Figure 1). T/I systems have pervaded the auto industry, and having once been a luxury only found in high-end vehicles, these technologies are now increasingly becoming standard even in entry-level vehicles. These systems provide users with in-vehicle access to their mobile devices (i.e., GPS navigation, phone calls, and music), either as a stand-alone native device, or as an extension of those devices via Bluetooth or via a USB connection to the vehicle.
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class=" wp-image-5338 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020CRTechArticleFig1-300x159.png" alt="" width="619" height="328" />Figure 1: Modern vehicle infotainment system: A Ford SYNC 3 system (Source: ford.com).</strong></h5>
Unbeknownst to most, these T/I systems continually record a variety of vehicle and user data. Some data that may be recorded include:

-Connected devices;
-Contact lists;
-Call logs;
-SMS texts;
-Engine on/off status;
-Wheel speeds;
-Odometer readings;
-Time stamps;
-Acceleration/braking events; and
-GPS speed, location, and guidance routes.

The recorded data can come from devices connected to a vehicle such as mobile phones and media players, the vehicle’s internal sensors, and from the navigation system by way of user input. Further, the data stored by the T/I systems is virtually permanent, even if a vehicle is damaged beyond repair due to a collision. Just like in a personal computer, if data is ‘deleted,’ it is not necessarily lost forever. Data can be retrieved with the right hardware, software, and knowledge.

Reconstruction experts now have a forensic tool available that can download data from these T/I systems. This data can provide new insights into vehicle motions in the moments leading up to a collision and throughout the life of a vehicle. These insights can aid in reconstructing collisions for litigation purposes, as well as in other areas such as combatting insurance fraud or in verifying alleged auto theft.
<h2><strong>Berla iVe System</strong></h2>
The preeminent tool that can access the valuable data recorded by T/I systems is the iVe system, developed by Berla Corporation. Based off the technology and techniques of retrieving data from portable GPS units, the iVe system is at the cutting edge of vehicle data retrieval. A vast amount of useful vehicle data can be made available; data that most people do not even know exists.

The iVe system is not necessarily a simple ‘plug-and-play’ system like other tools available to reconstruction experts; it is more of a complex series of individual electronic components, the use of which varies depending on the vehicle being accessed. Data collection from some vehicles is as simple as connecting a USB, linked between a PC and the Berla software, whereas other vehicles require the T/I systems to be dismantled to access and interface their delicate inner workings. The process can take anywhere from a few minutes to many hours and can often be laborious, but the information obtained can be relevant and the fruits of that labour may be worth it.

The Berla iVe system includes specially designed hand tools to extract and disassemble infotainment systems, electronics to access the recorded data, and software to download and analyze the data (Figure 2).
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class=" wp-image-5339 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020CRTechArticleFig2-300x191.png" alt="" width="620" height="395" />Figure 2: The Berla iVe system (Source: berla.co).</strong></h5>
There is even a mobile app to identify supported vehicles and associated data, and to provide detailed removal instructions (Figure 3). This ensures extraction and disassembly of the in-vehicle system is simple and easy, and that there is no damage to the vehicle or its components. The process begins by knowing which vehicles have infotainment systems that can be downloaded. The app includes a full list of supported vehicles, along with the type of information that can be retrieved, which varies from vehicle to vehicle. Thus, vehicles can be checked if they’re supported for download early on in the claims process.
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class=" wp-image-5340 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020CRTechArticleFig3-143x300.png" alt="" width="262" height="550" />Figure 3: Screenshot of the Berla iVe app interface.</strong></h5>
<h4><strong>Application Examples:</strong></h4>
Consider an insurance claim alleging that a vehicle was parked and left unattended when it was reportedly damaged by another vehicle. Depending on the type of vehicle, its whereabouts may be obtained for a given date and time and compared to the reported date. Combining this with traditional reconstruction techniques can help to verify if the reported information is valid. The same cross-referencing can be done with user phone records to potentially identify a vehicle’s occupant(s) in verification of a theft claim. Additionally, vehicle GPS tracking data can be used to determine vehicle motions in the moments leading up to a collision, which can assist in collision reconstruction efforts for litigation purposes, or even criminal investigations. These abilities hint at the obvious: can this information be obtained as a part of any examination of a vehicle? After all, nobody wants their data taken without their consent.

<strong>Pro-tip 1: Legal considerations:
</strong><em>Prior to obtaining data from telematics and infotainment systems, it is recommended that written authorization be first obtained from the vehicle’s owner due to the sensitive personal nature of some of the data available. For this purpose, a description of the nature and types of the sensitive information may prove to be useful.</em>

<strong>Pro-tip 2: </strong><strong>Be wary of what vehicle you connect your personal devices to:
</strong><em>By connecting your mobile device to a rental vehicle via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or USB, your personal data may be automatically uploaded to that vehicles infotainment system and become readily available for anyone to download it later. This means that the rental company or an investigator may obtain your data without your knowledge or approval, assuming they have the right technology. So, read the rental contract’s fine print!</em>

Further, your data can potentially be made available to anyone anywhere, as it may be obtained from your vehicle indirectly. For example, if your vehicle is ever sold, salvaged, or otherwise disposed of, its infotainment system may be removed and sold online. It is quite likely that if you have ever connected a mobile device to it, that data would still be there, in some stranger’s hands. For example, we were able to purchase a Ford infotainment system from eBay and subsequently downloaded its recorded data. Surprisingly, it had approximately 4 GB of data stored, including vehicle events (start/stops, headlight activation, etc.), GPS track logs showing the vehicle’s location at various dates and times, as well as call logs and contact information from several once-connected mobile devices. Be mindful of the fact that your personal data from your mobile or other electronic device may not be ‘safe,’ even if it’s connected to your own vehicle.
<h2><strong>Toyota Vehicle Control History</strong></h2>
In addition to the typical data recorded by a telematics/infotainment system (discussed above), Toyota vehicles (including Lexus and some Scion models) can also record additional information and store it under its umbrella term: Vehicle Control History (VCH).

Toyota VCH information was initially used by service technicians and engineers to analyze performance characteristics, and to troubleshoot problems reported by customers. To that latter point, with the implementation of Toyota Safety Sense autonomous technologies, such as forward collision warning or autonomous emergency braking, it was soon realized that this historical data could also be used to shed light on what happened in the moments leading up to a collision.

Vehicles are constantly monitoring data from sensors such as speed, steering wheel position, brake pedal status, and accelerator pedal position, just to name a few. Toyota VCH records the same basic information but records for longer periods of time and records data pertaining to driver inputs as well as the autonomous features. Events are triggered if certain thresholds are met, such as activation of the anti-lock braking system, emergency level steering by the driver, activation of the forward collision warning, or activation of the autonomous emergency braking, all of which is also stored in the electronics of the black box, but just accessed in a different way. Since VCH is constantly monitoring and capturing data, this information can be useful even if there was never a crash, i.e. if there was a near miss, or some other trigger that requested the system to record.

The system can also save black and white images from the forward-facing camera (located in the front end emblem or behind the rear-view mirror), which provides a short low resolution slideshow of what was happening ahead of the vehicle leading up to the event (Figure 4). Some of the triggered events in the VCH can provide data relating to the vehicle’s motion before a crash even occurs, upwards of 12 seconds surrounding that event (6 seconds before, and 6 seconds after).
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class=" wp-image-5341 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020CRTechArticleFig4-300x169.png" alt="" width="620" height="349" />Figure 4: Screenshot of a sample of VCH data (speed, brake, steering) and an image from the forward-facing camera.</strong></h5>
The images captured by the forward-facing camera of a vehicle are stored in the camera itself. Retrieval of these images requires that the camera still be connected to both the vehicle’s electrical system and the EDR when the download is completed. Put another way, if the vehicle was involved in a heavy collision and the camera was destroyed, then and those images would be inaccessible but the rest of the VCH data could still be downloaded.

The VCH data can be acquired two ways:
<ol>
 	<li>Plug-and-play through the vehicle’s OBD-II diagnostic port; or</li>
 	<li>If the vehicle’s electrical system is compromised due to damage, then by directly connecting to the EDR with a custom adapter cable and external power.</li>
</ol>
Once the vehicle is connected to a laptop, in order to communicate and download the VCH, users will require a paid subscription to Toyota’s Techstream software (Figure 5). Not only does this software provide the ability to access the VCH data, but it also provides an extensive Toyota-specific database of technical information that can be used to assist with the analysis or assessment of the incident.
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class=" wp-image-5342 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020CRTechArticleFig5-300x226.png" alt="" width="620" height="467" />Figure 5: Screenshot of the Toyota Techstream Software screen.</strong></h5>
<h2><strong>Summary and Benefits</strong></h2>
These aforementioned automotive advancements (EDRs, T/I systems, and Toyota VCH) offer varying levels and types of vehicle data available.

-Most modern vehicles are equipped with EDRs that can record collision related data.
-Many modern vehicles are equipped with both EDRs and T/I systems that can record historical vehicle data.
-Some modern vehicles (newer Toyota’s) are equipped with not only EDRs and T/I systems, but also Toyota VCH, which can record both collision related data as well as historical data related to other vehicle dynamics and operator inputs.

In some cases, a vehicle may have all three levels of data that can be accessed for use in collision claims, civil litigation regarding liability, or even criminal investigations. The data gathered from these systems can be used with other vehicle data and collision reconstruction techniques for a variety of purposes. Common uses include speed determinations and vehicle motion analysis, roadway lane positioning, theft verification, verification of reported circumstances, driver behaviour, etc.

The usefulness of EDRs has been regularly proven over the last decade. Their use has appeared in court decisions in the Canada and the US. While T/I systems and Toyota VCHs are still relatively new, they are rapidly pervading the auto industry and are increasingly making important contributions to understanding collisions or validating insurance claims.

		<title><![CDATA[Fort McMurray Flooding – One Year Later]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class=" wp-image-4260 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30FElogo-1.png" alt="" width="89" height="117" />In late April of 2020, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was subject to significant overland flooding, due to ice jamming on the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers. Working in tandem with our clients and partners, <strong>30 Forensic Engineering</strong> mobilized a team of environmental, remediation and structural engineers over the course of that summer, to assist with clean-up and restoration efforts.

<img class=" wp-image-5506 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/CAT-Loss-2021-PIC-300x195.png" alt="" width="425" height="276" />Among the biggest challenges faced in this work -- beyond the emergency drying-out and rubbish removal, and the need for pandemic control safety protocols -- was addressing the impacts of contaminated flood water and associated mould growth on contents, interior surfaces, and within walls &amp; floor assemblies. Given the duration, extent, and depth of the flooding, the impacts were substantial, and required many of our clients to undertake thorough investigations to delineate the impacts, define removals and restoration. This investigation, assessment and emergency removal work was all undertaken in coordination with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo’s permitting and planning team, as well as the Alberta Occupational Health and Safety guidelines.

In a CAT Loss situation, when building owners, management, tenants, and employees are vulnerable, one of the most important aspects is restoring the property. According to Jason Ehrenholz of Canadian Tire Corporation, “<em>opening to the public as quickly and safely as possible</em>”, is a top priority.

30 Forensic Engineering was in contact with our clients during the flood event so that we could understand the potential extent of the damages and hit the ground running upon arrival. We arrived in Fort McMurray on May 4, the day the evacuation was lifted, and immediately got to work investigating approximately 20 different properties. During the triage process, our specialized team was able to create preliminary site-specific scopes of work and assess properties for hazardous materials while restoration crews were manipulating contents. The 30 Forensic Engineering CAT Loss Unit remained in Fort McMurray for the next three months, seeing large scale remediations through to completion and helping their clients re-open properties as early (and safely) as possible.

From a perspective of lessons learned, it was our experience that the best outcomes occurred when the following key steps were taken:
<ol>
 	<li>Remove the contents from the flood impacted building and begin cleanup and drying as soon as possible. This allows for better control of interior relative humidity levels while minimizing damage and maximizing salvage of the interior building materials and contents.</li>
 	<li>Early communication with all parties, including insurers, adjusters, landlord, tenant, restoration contractors, and engineers, etc., to ensure all parties understand the scope and agree to the expectations.</li>
 	<li>Liaison with local or regional building, environmental, and health and safety inspectors for a thorough understanding of their signoff expectations and to maintain efficiency throughout the restoration process.</li>
</ol>
Looking ahead to the spring and summer, where issues such as storm-related floods, wildfires and other catastrophic events are more common, our team at 30 Forensics continue to advocate for the value of diligent planning and preparation to either prevent or mitigate the damages associated with catastrophic loss events, and to develop &amp; share ‘disaster response gameplans’ with key stakeholders in advance.

		<title><![CDATA[Catastrophic Loss Response - 30 Forensic Engineering]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class=" wp-image-4260 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30FElogo-1.png" alt="" width="100" height="132" />Our team understands that when a major disaster strikes, the need for timely response is critical. <strong>30 Forensic Engineering</strong> designs our Catastrophic Loss Response to fit the needs of the reality on the ground. We are committed to the restoration of residences, businesses, and infrastructure. In times of crisis, short-term realities must be considered alongside long-term needs. Our Catastrophic Loss Response approach is to:

• Assess and document the full scope of damage as quickly as possible;
• Provide direction on-site to emergency contractors for structures, systems, and contents;
• Collaborate with contractor teams and provide independent verification and quality control, including cost and scope management, code compliance, and adherence to environmental, health and safety regulations; and,
• Avoid secondary re-work and liability throughout the life cycle of the file.

Whether it’s a flood, wildfire, earthquake, or tornado, 30 Forensic Engineering can deploy multi-disciplinary teams throughout Canada and internationally immediately to support response efforts. We consider it our fundamental purpose to help those in need; it is a privilege to support our communities whenever called upon.

		<content><![CDATA[<img class=" wp-image-1981 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30FElogo.png" alt="" width="99" height="131" />For over a decade, our fire experts have been called upon to investigate, analyze, and opine on some of the most catastrophic fire and explosion-related events in Canadian history. Our highly-skilled and diverse team of experts provide a unique perspective and profound understanding of how and why fires and explosions occur. Whether the loss is associated with a complex metal refining process, a food processing facility, a commercial HVAC unit or an ordinary space heater, we have the right experts to provide insight into both the cause and broader context of the event. During the course of our investigations, we keep our clients informed of our progress and findings and make sure we meet their timelines for deliverables. When requested to do so, we produce reports that are concise, understandable, and actionable. <strong>30 Forensic Engineering</strong> strives to provide the most comprehensive, cost-effective investigation, reporting, and remediation options possible.

		<title><![CDATA[Flood Risk Assessment - 30 Forensic Engineering]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class=" wp-image-4260 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30FElogo-1.png" alt="" width="100" height="132" />Sea levels and temperatures are rising, and the intensity and frequency of significant storm events are increasing. <strong>30 Forensic Engineering</strong> has been involved with sufficient catastrophic loss events to recognize the value of good preparation and investment in loss prevention. To be prepared for flood events and to avoid the need for rushed last-minute preparations, residential and commercial property owners and managers must understand the risks associated with their specific situation. To this end, 30 Forensic Engineering’s flood risk assessment approach is to provide services that ensure that:

• Specific flood risk vulnerabilities are identified
• Tangible action plans are proposed, related to preventative maintenance, property upgrades, and emergency equipment procurement and storage
• Resilience and community-wide considerations are included in recommendations
• Help reduce claims costs associated with a flood event, and support insurance policy and risk discussions

		<title><![CDATA[Can We Build an Environment that will Better Prevent Falls on Stairs?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class=" wp-image-4260 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30FElogo-1.png" alt="" width="100" height="132" />Falls resulting in injury account for approximately $8.6 billion in direct and indirect costs in Canada each year<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, in addition to the further unquantifiable negative impacts on quality of life that they can cause. Any fall consists of two primary considerations: how was the person using the environment (what they were doing) and what role did the environment play (where they were doing it). How someone perceives and interacts with the built environment will play a direct role in their risk of falling. How often have you walked more cautiously when you know the floor is slippery, or held onto a handrail extra tightly when walking down a set of steep, old stairs? It is both our behaviour and the aspects of the built environment that we need to successfully negotiate daily to maintain our safety.

Building codes have been developed across Canada to introduce standardized regulations for the design and construction of buildings, although codes vary across the country. Add in that prior to standardized regulations being introduced, construction could vary widely from one building to the next.

The National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) was first introduced in 1941 and was intended to standardize construction requirements across Canada. However, there was no requirement for provinces and municipalities to adopt the NBCC. Hence, local municipalities could either adopt the NBCC in part or whole as their building by-law or choose to create their own building by-law. So, it was never universally adopted and relied upon throughout the country. The first version of the NBCC was revised with many subsequent editions that provided more stringent code requirements.

<img class=" wp-image-5617 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Slip-196x300.png" alt="" width="250" height="383" />Today British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec have all developed their own provincial building codes, whereas the remainder of the provinces and territories either adopted the NBCC, in part or in whole as noted above, or created their own building by-law.

The first version of the Ontario Building Code (OBC) came into effect in 1975. British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec followed suit years later and introduced their own building codes. Similar to the NBCC, provincial codes continue to be revised, and new editions are continually published with updated requirements to ultimately provide a safer built environment.

However, the building codes are not retroactively applicable to existing buildings unless extensive renovations are undertaken. Often in older buildings, conditions exist today that would not be considered currently acceptable but are allowed. It should also be noted that while building code updates typically follow the science and research, updates and revisions to codes consistently lag behind the science, and ongoing revisions are critical to ensure codes do not lag too far behind.

Stairs are a common feature that we navigate daily. Stairs have also been identified as one of the most hazardous locations in the home for falls.

In Ontario alone, falls on stairs accounted for almost twenty-five thousand emergency department visits in seniors between the years 2014 and 2015.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Research has shown that the likelihood of falls significantly decreases when the tread depth of steps are 10 in. (255 mm) or greater.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> This research, along with research from the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute demonstrating that longer stair runs help people better maintain their balance<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, resulted in the NBCC revising its requirements for tread depths. With the publication of the 2015 version of the NBCC, the minimum allowable tread depth for steps in houses was increased from 9-1/4 in. (235 mm) to 10 in. (255 mm). Similarly, the 2018 version of the BCBC changed the minimum required tread depth to 10 in. (255 mm). Interestingly, this amendment has not been made to the OBC to date, with minimum required tread depths still at 9-1/4 in. (235 mm); however, an increase in minimum tread depth is set to come into effect in 2022. This is a great example of the lag time for code updates with respect to the science, and the inconsistency in updates to standards across the country.

While this change is a great example of how updating the requirements for the built environment may help decrease the risk of falls, it is important to remember that building codes are not intended to be retroactively applied. Simply put, buildings constructed before the issuance of these codes do not need to be updated or renovated to meet the requirements of newer standards – it is just not feasible. Does that mean that people are more likely to fall on older (but allowable) construction? Yes, it does. This is a particularly relevant concern given our aging population.

Changes to stairway variability have also evolved to help pedestrians successfully ascend and descend stairs. Canadian building codes have always required risers and treads in any one stairway to be “uniform”. However, earlier versions of building codes did not specify what “uniformity” actually meant, so it was implied that normal construction tolerances, which were historically considered to be 3/8 in. (9.5 mm) or less for stairways, were acceptable. When the 2006 version of the OBC was published, uniformity requirements were finally specified in Ontario, and a maximum difference of 1/4 in. (6 mm) was permitted between all risers and treads in a stairway. This represents a significant reduction in tolerance relative to the prior accepted definition. The latter 2012 version of the OBC further revised this to allow for a maximum tolerance of 1/5 in. (5 mm) between adjacent treads or risers, and 2/5 in. (10 mm) difference in risers and treads in a whole stairway. We see these same requirements in the 2018 BCBC. This is another great example of codes playing catch up to the science.

<img class=" wp-image-5620 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/stairs-300x127.png" alt="" width="399" height="169" />These changes, which resulted in lower variability between riser heights and tread depths, were important in increasing the safety of pedestrians and the prevention of falls. Research has shown that our foot clearances are lowest in the middle of stairways compared to the transitions onto and off of stairways<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><sup>,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></sup>. This is because following our transition onto a stairway, our foot movements enter a repeatable and predictable pattern, like our leg movements during walking on level ground. So, while changes in riser heights can pose varying degrees of risk to balance depending on if they are located at transition steps or at mid-flight of a stairway, the more stringent uniformity requirements of the latest versions of Canadian building codes help to address the known behaviour of stair users.

Another aspect of stairs that has evolved over time includes handrail heights. When we look at the earlier versions of the NBCC and the 1975 version of the OBC, the height of handrails in public accessible buildings were required to be between 32 in. (813 mm) and 36 in. (914 mm).These height requirements have been amended over time and now, the 2012 OBC specifies that handrails must be between 34 in. (865 mm) and 38 in. (965 mm) in height. Research that explores the application of force in relation to handrail height when faced with balance loss not only demonstrated that physical demands decreased as handrail height increased, but that participants were able to withstand larger disturbances to their balance with a higher railing height<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. Increases in handrail heights have therefore helped ensure the safety of pedestrians when using stairways. The 2018 BCBC even allows handrails as high as 42 in. (1070 mm), and the OBC is set to revise maximum handrail heights to 42 in. (1070 mm) in 2020.

With the ongoing evolution of building codes and standards, it is important to keep both aspects of the built environment and the mechanics of falling in mind when attempting to understand how and why someone fell. Given our aging population, the rate at which Canadian codes are updated to meet the science is essential for the design and building of environments that are safer to use then ever before.

		<title><![CDATA[An Expert’s Perspective on the Agony of Collision]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class=" wp-image-4260 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30FElogo-1.png" alt="" width="100" height="132" />When an oncoming vehicle unexpectedly crosses the centerline, options are limited. No time to think, no time to plan—a reflexive steer may avoid a head-on impact but instead result in injury from colliding with other objects, vehicles, or vulnerable roadway users. During ensuing legal proceedings, allegations are often made that an alternative response to, say, steer in the other direction, or do nothing at all, would have avoided the collision. By presenting this opinion, one is suggesting that the actual actions of a driver should have been different because the outcome would have been different. Herein lies the issue termed ‘agony of collision’.

When a driver is faced with a collision hazard, a decision must be made as to whether or not it is urgent enough to warrant an aggressive response. The internal decision-making process requires the driver to compare their heading and speed to that of the hazard and determine if, without action taken on their part, a collision is likely to arise. Once a decision is made to act, the response is executed to completion—in this sense, an evasive response is a feed-forward process that cannot adapt to changes in a hazard’s behaviour during this short window of time.

<img class=" wp-image-5632 alignright" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/HFCRWebinarimage2-2.png" alt="" width="351" height="188" />Since drivers can only make use of the information immediately available to them when deciding upon an appropriate response, there exist circumstances where actions were taken which in retrospect were not objectively necessary to avoid a collision. Consider our centerline-crossing vehicle which returned to its lane while the right-of-way driver was undergoing evasive steering: the argument, however limited, may be that any collision would have been avoided had the right-of-way driver only continued along their original path. However, it is only with the benefit of hindsight that such an opinion can be advanced. When done correctly, an objective assessment of driver behaviour must be conducted only with what could be seen and known in the instances prior to a response being initiated to determine if the ‘agony of collision’ was sufficient to merit the exhibited actions.

Perceptual mechanisms exist which can be examined by driver behaviour experts to gauge the appropriateness of a response even in situations in which a collision with the initial hazard would not, in retrospect, have ultimately occurred. These mechanisms differ depending on the type of collision hazard presented. For example, when faced with a vehicle posing a head-on collision threat, drivers rely on the rate at which they are closing with the oncoming vehicle to determine if and when evasive actions are required. (Imagine yourself on a two-lane roadway faced with an oncoming vehicle in the process of overtaking. At some point, the oncoming vehicle may be so close that it is perceived as a real and urgent threat. In technical terms, the moment at which that realization is made is called the ‘looming threshold’ [1].)

In practice, the collision hazards regularly faced by drivers are varied and unique, but the same approach of comparing their response onset against expected hazard detection thresholds can nonetheless be applied. Driver behaviour research has demonstrated predictable relationships between the urgency of a hazard and the resulting driver behaviour (e.g., [2]), which can be used to assess the appropriateness of evasive actions across a broad range of hazard types and situations including head-on/rear-end collision threats, vehicles or pedestrians that violate the right-of-way—you name it. In some cases, therefore, the hazard presented by an approaching vehicle may justifiably warrant evasive maneuvering, whereas other situations may point to the responding driver as having acted atypically. What’s more, when a hazard does warrant evasive maneuvering, there is often a range of responses which are characteristically ‘normal’. For example, operators faced with obstacles encroaching from the side may respond with braking, steering, or both in any order [2]. In these cases, a driver cannot be faulted for failing to select a particular response from among a normal range even if doing so may have resulted in a different or more favourable outcome. The appropriateness of a driver’s response, in other words, must be assessed against the totality of known driver behaviour data and must not be tied to the outcome of any specific event.

To the unfamiliar, the concept of the ‘agony of collision’ may seem vague, but technical principles exist which can lend objective backing to the argument that such a phenomenon does or does not apply to a given situation. With due consideration for the properties of the incident hazard and environment, a robust scientific opinion can be rendered to address whether a driver’s behaviour aligned with that of a typically attentive motorist, and can help advance or deny the claim of ‘agony of collision’ being a causal factor in a collision event

		<title><![CDATA[Effect of Extreme Weather on our Buildings and Associated Measures]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class=" wp-image-4260 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30FElogo-1.png" alt="" width="100" height="132" />

Environmental loads, such as wind, have a critical impact on the structural design and assessment of buildings and infrastructures. Climate change and extreme climatic events are threats to the reliability and safety of the built environment. “This has led to a growing demand to investigate the resilience of our structures under extreme climate conditions,” says <a href="https://www.30fe.com/associates/kzandi30fe-com/"><strong>Dr. Kamyab Zandi M.Sc., Ph.D.</strong></a>, Docent, Senior Associate, Civil/Structural &amp; Building Science. Over the last decade, many structures have been damaged and failed due to extreme weather conditions, such as British Columbia’s <em>flood of floods</em> in November 2021, and the intense windstorm Southern Ontario and Quebec experienced on May 21, 2022.

The wind speed that recently swept across Southern Ontario and Quebec reportedly reached more than 130 kilometres an hour. Even though structures are designed to resist such impacts, regular inspection and maintenance of structural components minimizes the risk of exacerbating existing issues. <a href="https://www.30fe.com/associates/rakan-jaber/"><strong>Rakan Jaber, M.Eng.</strong></a>, Associate, Civil/Structural &amp; Building Science, outlines some of the measures that can be taken to mitigate the risk of such extreme weather events:
<ol>
 	<li>Regular inspections of your building can help to identify any loose or missing building material on walls and roofs. Wind pressure increases with height, so structural elements at higher levels must be carefully inspected in order to sustain wind loads. A building must also resist both compression and tension, so structural elements must be well secured.</li>
 	<li>If your building is located in an area known to have severe and frequent storms, install storm shutters or other semi-permanent wind protection.</li>
 	<li>Watch for dead trees or brittle tree branches in the vicinity of your building. Cut down dead trees and trim risky tree branches that may break off during a storm.</li>
 	<li>Store vehicles and yard items in a garage space.</li>
 	<li>Keep an eye on storm alerts /forecasts and prepare a disaster/emergency kit as necessary.</li>
</ol>

		<title><![CDATA[Hot off the Press: 30 Forensic Engineering's Biomechanical Experts Published in the Journal of Applied Biomechanics]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft wp-image-5941 " src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30Logo_RGB-224x300.png" alt="" width="70" height="94" />

In collaboration with <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/kinesiology-health-sciences/people-profiles/jack-callaghan">Dr. Jack Callaghan</a>, Canada Research Chair in Spine Biomechanics and Injury Prevention at the University of Waterloo and <a href="https://kin.educ.ubc.ca/person/kayla-fewster/">Dr. Kayla Fewster</a>, Assistant Professor in School of Kinesiology at the University of British Columbia, Drs. <strong><a href="https://www.30fe.com/leadership-team/chad-gooyers/">Chad Gooyers</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="https://www.30fe.com/leadership-team/rob-parkinson/">Rob Parkinson</a> </strong>(Senior Biomechanical Experts at 30 Forensic Engineering) have recently published one of the first studies to document the peak lumbar spine forces and motion experienced by human volunteers during simulated low speed rear-end collisions.

Twelve males and twelve females between the ages of 18-35, free from any prior low back or neck injury spine injury, experienced simulated collisions conducted on a custom-built collision simulation sled (Figure 1). The participants were exposed to rear-end collision severities of approximately 8 km/h, consistent with the vehicle speeds observed in parking lot collisions and bumper-to-bumper traffic, which is below published thresholds associated with soft tissue neck injury. Prior to any testing, ethics approval for research involving human participants was obtained from the Office for Research Ethics at the University of Waterloo.

<em>Figure 1: Photograph of the custom-built collision simulation sled. Participants were seated and belted in the automotive seat. The seat assembly was then released from the top of the ramp and rolled back to impact 4 springs.</em>

A motion capture system was used to measure the position of the thorax and pelvis, while seat back forces were estimated using a pressure measurement system installed on the seat back and the seat pan. The data gathered was incorporated into a 3D biomechanical model to estimate the forces occurring within the lumbar spine.

Consistent with prior research using cadavers and crash test dummies, we found that the peak spine forces were low and were well below the forces that are considered safe for repeated lifting tasks in the workplace (Figure 2) and were insufficient to cause injury to the lumbar spine.

		<title><![CDATA[Knowledge is Safety: How well do you know the regulations (and your responsibilities) related to designated substances/hazardous materials?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-5941 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30Logo_RGB-224x300.png" alt="" width="70" height="94" />

Canadian claims professionals familiar with the construction and damage restoration industries are also aware of the high level of risk associated with these industries and the pre-eminent importance of robust health and safety protocols to reduce those risks for everyone involved. In our multidisciplinary remediation practice, most of our construction and damage restoration files involve risk mitigation related to asbestos and lead—referred to as ‘designated substances’ in Ontario and ‘hazardous materials’ in all other Canadian provinces and territories. In our experience, Canadian claims professionals generally demonstrate a clear-eyed respect for the health and safety hazards posed by these harmful substances. Surprisingly then, we continue to see remediation files that involve asbestos and lead spills, the involvement of public adjustors, and civil litigation due to worker exposure. This led us to a question: in an industry so safety and risk conscious, how do mistakes and missteps related to designated substances/hazardous materials continue to happen?

In search of answers, we surveyed more than 90 property claims professionals working across Canada to gauge the frequency with which their claims involve designated substances, as well as their level of knowledge about these substances and the relevant safety regulations by which they are governed.

The results showed that 43 percent of claims professionals ‘often’ or ‘always’ handle property claims that involve a designated substances/hazardous materials report, 45 percent ‘sometimes’ handle property claims involving a designated substances/hazardous materials report, and 11 percent ‘never’ handle claims involving a designated substances/hazardous materials report. We chose to exclude from our study further responses from the ‘never’ group to avoid skewing the data regarding industry knowledge in this area. However, the size of the ‘never’ group is notable (11 percent), given the prevalence of designated substances/hazardous materials in claims involving property damage and restoration.

In terms of general knowledge about designated substances/hazardous materials, 56 percent of the participants characterized themselves as ‘very aware,’ 43 percent as ‘moderately aware,’ and 1 percent as ‘not aware.’

Where we began to gain some insight into our question was in the results related to familiarity with the relevant provincial/territorial regulations and guidelines, for example, Ontario Regulation 490/09 and WorkSafeBC’s OHS Regulations. While approximately 77 percent of participants indicated they were moderately familiar and 11 percent were very familiar with these regulations, 12 percent of those surveyed indicated they were ‘not familiar at all’ with these essential regulations and guidelines. This result surprised us and revealed a critical gap due to the legal responsibilities of claims professionals who deal with designated substances/hazardous materials under these same regulations.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6010" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/DSS-Picture-1-1024x593.png" alt="" width="1024" height="593" />

For example, Ontario’s Occupational Health and Safety Act (the ‘OHSA’) defines ‘Owner’ as a <em>“trustee, receiver, mortgagee in possession, tenant, lessee, or occupier of any lands or premises used or to be used as a workplace, and a person who acts for or on behalf of an owner as an agent.”</em> This means that an insurer or claims professionals may become the legal ‘owner’ of a workplace following a loss.

Further, the OHSA requires project owners to <em>“determine whether any designated substances are present at the project site”</em> and to <em>“ensure that a prospective constructor”</em> is aware of the designated substances hazard <em>“before entering into a binding contract with the constructor.”</em> Similarly, constructors have a responsibility to inform contractors and subcontractors of designated substances at the project workplace, and these employers have a responsibility to inform their workers of the hazards. Workers have the right to be notified of hazards in every workplace and on every project, and it is ultimately the responsibility of the project ‘owner’ to confirm the presence or absence of designated substances. In short, insurers and claims professionals are often legally responsible for identification of designated substances/hazardous materials, such as asbestos and lead, after a loss requiring property damage restoration.

With this in mind, if 12 percent of claims professionals are unfamiliar with the regulations, they are likely also unfamiliar with their responsibilities under those regulations. If these responsibilities are not fulfilled, hazardous spills and exposures may occur, and legal action may be initiated. While it is possible that this 12 percent of participants are newer to the industry, a project owner’s lack of experience does not shield them from their responsibilities under the law, nor is it a legitimate excuse when a spill or exposure occurs.

Another insight gained through our survey results relates to the use of qualified experts on losses involving hazardous substances/designated materials. While 86 percent of participants reported relying on qualified experts to assess the presence of these substances, 11 percent of participants reported relying on contractors. While remediation/abatement contractors are well-versed in the removal and disposal of building materials that contain designated/hazardous substances, they may not be familiar with sampling and testing protocols and guidelines. In fact, some provinces (BC and Alberta, for example) mandate that samples be collected by a ‘qualified’ or ‘competent person.’ According to OHSA, a competent person is defined as someone with knowledge, training, and experience with the management and control of these substances, who is familiar with the associated hazards, legislation, and guidelines. Such competent persons include certified industrial hygienists, safety professionals, engineers, and people with extensive occupational health and safety experience in the abatement and remediation industry. Generally, these are unbiased third parties, engaged by project owners to complete all necessary sampling and testing.

When it comes to engaging a competent person to assess and report designated substances/hazardous materials on a loss site, our survey found that while 80 percent of respondents engage such an expert to assess and report, 16 percent sometimes or never engage a competent expert, and approximately 4 percent could not answer this question. That’s 20 percent of respondents who rarely or never engage an expert assessor and who, based on the previous discussion, may not understand why engaging such an expert is necessary. The reason, again, is responsibility under provincial health and safety regulations. When a claims professional takes control of a site, they take on responsibility for engaging a competent person to assess and report on designated substances/hazardous materials.

Once again, we looked at whether years of experience could explain this knowledge gap, and again, we were surprised. Of the 27 percent of respondents who said they were not aware of their responsibility to engage a competent assessor, 73 percent had over 10 years’ experience in the insurance industry, 14 percent had 6 to 10 years’, and 14 percent had less than 5 years’. Any illusion that this critical knowledge gap is inevitably bridged over time, does not bear out in our results.

Through an optimist’s lens, you might say our survey revealed that most Canadian claims professionals have a satisfactory level of knowledge about designated substances/hazardous materials and their legal responsibilities under the applicable provincial health and safety regulations. But in an industry in which the risk of serious workplace injury is so high, can ‘most’ be considered good enough? Anyone working in the construction and damage restoration industries will tell you that one incident or injury is one too many. And as with all incidents, we believe that those related to worker exposure to designated substances/hazardous materials are avoidable. By ensuring all claims professionals are armed with knowledge of provincial health and safety regulations and guidelines, as well as their statutory responsibilities under these directives, we can make worksites safer and reduce risk for everyone involved.

		<title><![CDATA[Lights, camera, reconstruction: How videos can play a role in forensic collision analysis]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Dash cams catch a lot of crazy things on the road, but it is doubtful that there are many videos topping the one currently circulating of Kia becoming airborne upon impact with a wheel that became detached from a Chevrolet pickup. The incident occurred on a Southern California freeway on March 23, 2023, and was captured by an uninvolved Tesla’s onboard camera (the ‘camera car’).

The footage of the dramatic and unexpected turn of events that transpired on the freeway, while shocking, offers valuable insight into many potentially contributing factors, all of which can be unpacked from the video.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOosn78WsMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class=" wp-image-6194 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/Nishan-Kia1-300x182.png" alt="" width="722" height="438" /></a>

For instance, the Chevrolet appeared to have an aftermarket tire/wheel setup, which raises questions about the installation of the left front wheel (the wheel which eventually came off). Questions regarding the vehicle’s mechanical fitness, appropriateness of the aftermarket components, and how the wheel was secured prior to the incident are all factors that may have played a part in what appeared to be a sudden component failure.

But what about the Kia? Could the driver have done anything differently? Given the timing between the wheel detachment and impact, it’s unlikely there was much, if anything, the driver could have done. However, the Kia was in the process of passing the camera car, and if it was speeding at the time, could any excessive speed have contributed to the way this incident unfolded? In other words, if the Kia was speeding, and had it not been, would the detached wheel simply have passed in front of it, or struck it at a different orientation which would not have resulted in the vehicle becoming airborne?

<strong><u>A Focus on the Camera</u></strong>

As it relates to assessing the distances, timings and ultimately, the speeds that can be extrapolated from the video, it’s first important to understand the limitations of the camera system itself – something that simply can’t be done by analyzing the online footage alone.

While it may be tempting to rely on an internet version of the video, uploading video often compresses the original file and can alter its metadata. This process can also reencode the timing data or alter the playback speed, effectively changing the actual frame rate of the video. Unfortunately, this can result in an inaccurate understanding of event timing. Ensuring the video is correctly obtained and accurately documenting its the chain of custody is imperative for not only the analysis, but also in ensuring the video is permissible as evidence in any future potential legal actions.

Testing the camera car’s onboard camera is the most precise method in which to determine any variability that can occur in frame timing. Once determined, understanding vehicle speeds and distances becomes a task of reconstructing the video in a virtual environment by way of first understanding the position and camera parameters from the camera car itself.

<strong><u>A Reconstruction in 3D</u></strong>

In these sorts of cases, match-moving is the technique of choice in determining these parameters. This technique, though primarily used by visual effects artists, has been adopted by forensic video analysts and collision reconstruction experts to determine the camera’s movement so 3D objects can be placed relative to the moving camera. The process involves tracking various pixels, usually referencing immovable roadway objects such as dashed roadway lines, signage, etc., to iteratively solve the perspective, focal length, lens distortion, and ultimately camera position over every frame.

Once those parameters are solved, we can place 3D models of the involved vehicles in a virtual environment, orienting them to reflect their position at any given frame. The alignment process of a 3D object to reflect its true position shown in a single frame or photograph is referred to as photogrammetry: the science of extracting measurement from photographs.

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Figure 1: 3D placed Kia, airborne, and the Chevrolet, placed within the 3D environment.</h5>
Though arduous, this process can help answer those all too imperative questions of speed and avoidability from what would otherwise be classified as a freak accident. Furthermore, the 3D visualizations are not only compelling, but can also offer further insight, from different vantage points not originally available from the dashcam view alone.

		<title><![CDATA[A Biomechanical Safety Lesson for E-Scooter Riders]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-4260 alignleft" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/30FElogo-1.png" alt="" width="100" height="132" />Did you know the City of Ottawa is currently in the midst of its fourth electric scooter, or ‘e-scooter,’ pilot program? E-scooters have become increasingly popular as a fun and convenient means of transportation, and they are now available in the Nation’s Capital, with new restrictions on riders as well as changes to the scooters themselves<sup>[1]</sup>.

Whether you’re a cyclist, pedestrian, or e-scooter rider, you are a ‘vulnerable road user’ when compared to motor vehicles and are exposed to the risk of sustaining injuries if involved in a collision. So, what should you know about riding an e-scooter?
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6275 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/E-Scooter-Parliament.jpg" alt="" width="797" height="518" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: E-scooters are rolling out in Ottawa in Phase 3 of its pilot program<sup>[1]</sup>.</em></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Know the Risks of Riding</strong></span>

Research shows that the most common cause of injuries to e-scooter riders is not from contact with vehicles, but from falls!

A study of 105 adults injured while riding e-scooters in Washington, DC, found that approximately 67% of incidents were the result of falls due to adverse surface features or infrastructure (bad roads or rough travelling surfaces). Only 10% of incidents were due to collisions with motorized vehicles<sup>[2]</sup>. Similar findings were observed in Copenhagen, Denmark, where falls accounted for almost 90% of e-scooter rider injuries<sup>[3]</sup>.

Head/facial injuries were the most common ones sustained by e-scooter riders who suffered a fall in these studies, with less than 4% of riders wearing helmets at the time of their fall. As with cyclists and pedestrians, head–ground impacts are an important determinant of severe head injuries with e-scooter riders.

In Ottawa, e-scooters are allowed on roads with a posted speed limit of 50 km/h or less. The shared e-scooters use geofence technology that enforces ‘no ride,’ ‘no park,’ and ‘slow zones,’ which include transit stations, NCC pathways, the ByWard Market, and City of Ottawa parking garages. The operating speed of the shared e-scooters is capped at 20 km/h, or 12 km/h in the ‘slow zones.’ However, helmets are not required for riders aged 18 or older!

<strong><u>Fall Kinematics</u></strong>

A recent study by Posirisuk et al.<sup>[4]</sup> completed a computational prediction of head–ground impact kinematics in e-scooter falls. To simulate falls, the authors incorporated potholes of varying widths (20 cm, 40 cm, 60 cm, and 80 cm) and depths (3 cm, 6 cm, and 9 cm) to explore the effects on the head–ground impact force and velocity for a wide range of rider anthropometry (5<sup>th</sup> percentile female to a 95<sup>th</sup> percentile male) at various e-scooter riding speeds (10 km/h, 15 km/h, 20 km/h, 25 km/h, and 30 km/h).

The computer-based predictions were validated by comparison to a human volunteer test carried out by the Swifty scooter company<sup>[5]</sup>. That test involved a volunteer riding an e-scooter at approximately 10 km/h and falling to the ground after entering a pothole 80 cm wide and 7.2 cm deep (Figure 2).

<img class="wp-image-6276 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/E-Scooter-Falls.png" alt="" width="508" height="356" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Comparison between the pothole test by Swifty (Allerton, 2020) and computer-based predictions (reproduced from Posirisuk 2022 study).</em></p>
The scooter fall could be divided into two phases: (1) the contact phase, in which the e-scooter encounters the pothole’s second edge; and (2) the discharge phase, in which the rider falls from the e-scooter and becomes airborne before impacting the ground. The authors observed three different types of fall kinematics, which depended on the pothole depth, width, and e-scooter speed, captured in the following figures:

<strong>Type 1:</strong> 66% of falls resulted in the rider being discharged forward from the e-scooter, with a body part contacting the ground before head–ground contact.

<img class="size-full wp-image-6278 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/E-Scooter-Falls_Type-2.png" alt="" width="835" height="164" />

<strong>Type 2:</strong> 28% of falls resulted in the rider being discharged from the e-scooter, with the head contacting the ground first.

<img class="size-full wp-image-6277 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/E-Scooter-Falls_Type-1.png" alt="" width="835" height="201" />

<strong>Type 3:</strong> 6% of falls results in the rider being discharged from the e-scooter, with their body rotating to the side before impacting the ground on the side, followed by head–ground impact.

<img class="size-full wp-image-6279 aligncenter" src="https://www.30fe.com/wp-content/uploads/E-Scooter-Falls_Type-3.png" alt="" width="835" height="191" />

The authors noted that Type 3 falls increased along with pothole depth. All falls were Type 2 when the e-scooter speed was 30 km/h. The authors also noted that none of the riders fell when the depth of the pothole was 3 cm (12% of the e-scooter wheel’s diameter), and that potholes deeper than 6 cm significantly increased the risk of falls.

The City of Ottawa’s recommended maintenance quality standard<sup>[6]</sup>, which applies to the maintenance operations on bridges, paved and treated road surfaces, including cycling lanes, paved and gravel shoulders, defines the treatment for surface distortions that could pose a risk to cyclists and motorists. This standard allows surface distortions, like potholes, to be up to 25 cm in width and 5 cm in depth on roadways and up to 40 cm in width and 8 cm in depth on paved or non-paved shoulders. This means e-scooter riders may encounter surface discontinuities on roadways that may cause a fall to an inattentive, unprepared, and/or inexperienced rider.

<strong><u>Biomechanical Injury Assessment – Head Injuries</u></strong>

The above computer model detailed an increase in head impact speed as e-scooter speed increased. At 10 km/h, the head impacted the ground at an average speed of 4.8 m/s, while at 20 km/h, the head impacted the ground at an average speed of 6.9 m/s.

To assess the risk of injury associated with these impacts, head accelerations can be compared to the Injury Assessment Reference Value (IARV) and probability curves published by Mertz et al.<sup>[7]</sup> The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) , a measurement that quantifies the severity of a head impact by incorporating its magnitude and duration, can also be calculated and compared to risk curves for severe brain injury (AIS ≥ 4) for the adult population; where AIS ≥ 4 (severe) and above include penetrating skull injuries leading to brain injury, large contusions and hematomas (e.g., subdural, subarachnoid, and intracerebral).

Research by Cripton et al.<sup>[8]</sup>, showed that head impact speeds of 5.4 m/s and 6.3 m/s (i.e., within the range obtained in the above scooter study) resulted in peak head accelerations of 601 to 824 g when not wearing a helmet (Figure 4). Mertz et al.<sup>[9]</sup> estimated a 50% risk of fracture for an adult skull at a peak head acceleration of approximately 260 g, with head accelerations greater than 500 g resulting in over 99% risk of fracture for an adult skull. Based on the HIC results, it is also noteworthy that the probability of severe (AIS ≥ 4) brain injury was determined to be 99.9% for an unhelmeted 5.4 m/s impact speed (Figure 3)<sup>[10]</sup>.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 4: Peak head accelerations for both helmeted and unhelmeted drop tests from Cripton et al. An unbraced fall from 1.5 meters to 2 m results in peak resultant head accelerations of 601 to 824 g (outlined in red).</em></p>
<strong><u>Mechanical Thresholds Associated with Traumatic Brain Injury</u></strong>

The head acceleration levels discussed above can also be compared to the acceleration levels associated with concussion in the peer-reviewed literature. For example, Brennan et al.<sup>[11]</sup> completed a systemic review of studies that published objectively measured biomechanical forces associated with a concussive event. This included 13 studies which documented American football athletes, at either a high school or collegiate level, and unhelmeted amateur rugby athletes. The average linear acceleration associated with concussion reported by Brennan et al. is 98.68 g. The study had a 95% confidence interval of 82.36 to 115.0 g, meaning there is a 95% probability that the mechanical threshold for concussion is in that range.

Based on the findings presented by Cripton et al., an e-scooter rider who is thrown from their scooter while not wearing a helmet will likely sustain a head exposure that is approximately 6 to 8.4 times greater than the threshold associated with medically diagnosed concussions. Comparatively, helmeted riders will likely sustain a head exposure that is approximately 1.6 to 1.8 times greater. Stated differently, a helmet will likely prevent serious skull and brain injuries but may not eliminate the risk of a concussion.

While helmets are not required for riders aged 18 or older, when considering the above biomechanical data, helmet use should be encouraged for everyone!
